# General Overview

1. Developed in the 50s, 60s and 70s by Aaron T. Beck.[^1][^2][^3]
2. Has been shown through testing to be an effective form of psychotherapy on a wide range of issues, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, and personality disorders.[^2] CBT can be used to prevent issues as well.[^3] Studies have shown that it can match and even outperform antidepressant drugs. [^1]
3. Was the first general psychotherapy treatment that combined a detailed treatment protocol manual with outcome research. Led to a more empirical view of psychotherapy. [^2]
4. CBT can help with mild cases of depression in as little as 12 weeks.[^4]
5. Three points about peoples’ thoughts:
	1. One’s mood is based on their thoughts.[^4]
	2. When you are depressed you have more negative thoughts.[^4]
	3. Your negative thoughts can be totally out of touch with reality.[^4]
6. When you look at your past and your future, all you see is sadness and misery.[^4]
# Evidence
1. In a pilot study titled “Comparative Efficacy of Cognitive Therapy and {pharmacotherapy in the Treatment of Depressed Patients” published in 1977, CBT outperformed Tofranil (a popular antidepressant drug used in the 70s).[^5]
	1. Test started with 19 patients who only used CBT and 25 patients who used antidepressants. The patients were randomly selected to each group.[^5]
	2. The study lasted 12 weeks.[^5]
	3. Patients came in with moderate to severe symptoms they had for years. Three quarters were suicidal and most had gone for other treatments before which failed.[^5]
	4. 15 / 19 in the CBT group had a complete recovery; 2 had moderate improvement; 1 had no improvement; 1 dropped out before the end of the study. 5 / 25 in the drug group had a complete recovery; 7 had moderate improvement; 5 had no improvement; 8 dropped out before the end of the study.[^5]
	5. The test was single-blind (the evaluators were not the therapists and did not know which patient belonged to which group.)[^5]
# Structure

## Preliminary Steps

1. Take a self-assessment test. Taking these tests can give you a more accurate picture than a therapist who does not use these tests. These tests are “highly accurate”.[^6][^7] This seems consistent with some ideas expressed by Daniel Kahneman about how testing leads to more accurate predictions than just relying on feel and intuition. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
2. If you are severely depressed and/or have strong suicidal inclinations then get professional help. It is possible that you can succeed without it, but, just to be safe, you should get help.[^8]
3. If you are experiencing hallucinations, you believe that your life is being controlled, etc. this can be a sign of severe mental illness and you should seek professional help.[^9]
4. If you feel like you are losing your mind and experience extreme panic and you feel like you are losing control, these are signs of anxiety. They are not signs that you are actually losing your mind.[^9]
5. Depression can cause physical symptoms (pain, trembling, numbness, etc.). As you improve, your symptoms will vanish. However, you should go to the doctor to confirm that it is indeed depression-induced symptoms rather than something else.[^9]
    
### Mania

1. Manic people have powerful mood swings.[^10]
2. On the upside, they can have tremendous self-confidence, energy, a feeling that you don’t need to sleep and that you are the cusp of some breakthrough, among other symptoms.[^10]
3. On the downside, one feels tremendous depression and lethargy.[^10]
4. Some manic people may actually not want to be cured at all for some time because the upside feels so good.[^10]
5. Lithium is the optimal response under supervision. It is even better in conjunction with therapy or some self-help program.[^10]
## Thoughts
1. There is the objective reality and our subjective interpretation. Our interpretation affects our mood and emotions.[^11]
2. Many people have interpretations of reality which are totally divorced from reality.[^11]
3. Despite this, these thoughts will seem very real, because you feel that they are real.
4. Your feelings and thoughts can create a vicious cycle.[^12]
5. Realizing that your feelings do not represent reality, but rather, just represent your thoughts is a good step to fighting these feelings.[^12]
6. Some therapists feel that these is no such thing as a bad feeling. However, this is not the case. Some feelings have negative consequences and are inaccurate.[^12]
### General Patterns
{This section drastically reorganizes the way the author of Feeling Good presented the general thought patterns}

1. Predicting the Future. One way to do this is through Overgeneralization, such as, “I failed at this so I will never be able to do anything”.[^11]
2. Focusing on the Bad and Negating the Good, like someone gives you a compliment and you think to yourself that they didn’t mean it. A bit different than focusing on the bad. These patterns can be used when evaluating a situation and can also be used when evaluating oneself or others. An extreme form of this is “labeling”, where you define the entire character of a person (including yourself) in a very narrow and simplistic way.[^11]
3. Mind Reading. Such as, “He didn’t say hi to me because he doesn’t like me”.[^11]
4. Emotional Reasoning. This can be applied in multiple ways. A person may feel that they are a failure and that feeling will reinforce their belief that they are a failure. Another way a person might feel that doing something is going to be so hard and so they therefore believe that it is very hard.[^11]
5. Shoulds and Musts. This can be applied to oneself or others. To oneself, you feel that you should or must do something (or a lot of things. So many things, or so many difficult things, that there is no way for you to actually do them) and then when you can’t do them, you feel terrible.[^11]
   To others, it might feel like expectations, and when they do not live up to your 
   expectations (which they of course will not, at least from time to time), you get angry and frustrated with them.[^11]
6. Blaming Yourself for Everything. One might feel responsible for their kid misbehaving in school, when in reality, a kid's natural personality, genes, things in the school, and other influences on a kid’s nature will also play massive roles in a kid misbehaving.[^11]
   It seems to me that perhaps there is some truth when people blame themselves. Like the mother over here perhaps could have done a better job raising her kid so that despite all of the other influences, the child would not have acted out. But I think the natural response when reading this story is that nobody is going to raise their child so well that they will never make trouble, and there really is no way of knowing whether there was something feasible that the mother could have done to raise her kid better.[^13]

# Low Self-Esteem
1. People with low self-esteem generally don't like themselves.[^14]
2. When they mess up, they feel disproportionately depressed as they feel people will look at them as a failure.[^14]
3. This is particularly damaging because people with low self-esteem rely heavily upon other's approval to maintain whatever little self-esteem they have.[^14]
4. Even psychologists fall prey to low self-esteem and can't see the very fact that they are being strongly affected by a cognitive disorder.[^14]
## What Doesn't Work
1. Accomplishments can lead to satisfaction, which can mask feelings of low self-esteem. However, they can't lead to happiness and real self-esteem.[^14]
2. Feeling loved doesn't provide self-esteem.[^14]
3. Talking to someone to get things off your chest can help one feel better, but it probably will not provide a lasting solution. You need to reevaluate how you look at yourself.[^14]
4. Pinpointing the source of one's low self-esteem ("when you were younger, your parents didn't treat you properly") doesn't help without taking that knowledge to reevaluate how you look at yourself. Just knowing the source doesn't help.[^14]
## What Does Work
### Fixing Cognitive Disorders
1. Low self-esteem is caused by cognitive disorders. Fixing those disorders helps with low self-esteem.[^14]
   One does this by:
	1. Recognizing one's distorted thoughts. A sudden disproportionate negative reaction is a que that one is having distorted negative thoughts.[^14]
	2. At this point, one should try to examine his thoughts and try to figure out what it was that they were thinking about.[^14]
	3. Think about in what way they are distortions and how one can respond to them.[^14]
	4. The response has to be true. If the response is not true and you know it (which you obviously will), then it won't help you.[^14]
	5. Writing it down (how they are distortions and how one can respond) helps make this more effective.[^14]
2. It may be difficult to find responses, at least at first.[^14]
3. Some negative thoughts may have you stumped for a response. Be patient. After some time you will think of some good response. You can even ask others for help responding to specific thoughts if you are up to it.[^14]
4. Remember to work with thoughts, not feelings. You may feel like garbage, but that isn't what you are dealing with, at least not directly. That thought is probably perfectly honest: you do feel terrible. You deal with the thought that led to that feeling.[^14]
## How a Therapist Should Deal with a Patient with Low Self-Esteem
### Freud's View
1. Freud believed that the therapist should agree with the patient.[^14]
2. Freud believed that people are intrinsically evil, and so the patients low self-esteem was actually a sign that the patient was thinking clearly.[^14]
### View of the CBT School of Thought
1. The therapist should challenge the patient because the patient is not thinking clearly.[^14]
2. Perhaps the therapist should have some sort of middle ground because otherwise, the patient may not feel that the therapist really understands them. This is especially true because there is almost certainly some truth to what the patient thinks about themselves, as we all suffer from different issues. Completely invalidating what the patient is thinking may not work.[^13]
