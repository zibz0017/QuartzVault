# Hamas
## Creation of Hamas:
1. During the 1970s and 1980s Israel was largely indifferent or perhaps even supportive of the precursor organization to Hamas (called Mujama al-Islamiya Islamic), calling them a charity organization. [^1]
2. Israel did this either because they wanted to create an organization that could fight against the PLO[^1] or because they wanted an organization that they could broker peace with.[^2]
3. At the time, the PLO was considered a legitimate and major threat as they were committing massive terror attacks, such as hijacking planes.[^2]
4. At the time, radical Islam was not seen as a threat (the PLO was a secular movement) {Not sure what their motives were, or if they still are the same now}.[^2]
5. There were some experts who were worried about what this charity could turn into, but without the benefit of hindsight, it may be hard to determine how legitimately these concerns should have been taken.[^2]
# Claims of Israel Violating International Law:
*Note: This analysis does not include the fact that according to halacha, perhaps the right thing is to kill innocent goyim and the like for the sake of saving Jews. This is looking at it from a secular moral perspective.*
## Recent Claims
### White Phosphorus
1. There are claims that Israel uses white phosphorus. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
2. The legality of using white phosphorus is tricky. It seems that it is technically legal to use but it is difficult to do so in a legal way. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
	1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> Israel is using it for illumination purposes which is legal. [^2]
	2. <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Counter:</span> Israel has been sometimes using white phosphorus during the day, so it would seem that at least sometimes they are not using white phosphorus for illumination purposes. [^2]
### Israeli leaders use Genocidal language
1. Israeli leaders used genocidal language when referring to the Palestinians at the beginning of the 2023 Gaza War. ("Treat them like animals."; "No water, no food, no electricity.") {<font color="#ff0000">Need source. South Africa claim of genocide against Israel has a lot of quotes.</font>}
	1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> Some of the quotes may be referring to Hamas particularly, even if they say "Gaza" or "Gazans" (the same way a Ukrainian might discuss fighting the "Russians" even though he is only talking about the Russian army, not the Russian people).
	2. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> It is not uncommon for leaders to use very hawkish language even if they actually do not carry out such hawkish policy. They are playing politics and so they may need to make certain strong statements to maintain the support of the people. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">need to get some examples</span>} [^2]
### Turning off Water
1. At the beginning of the 2023 Gaza War, Israel turned off some of the water that was going into Gaza. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
2. This may be a war crime, although this might not count as genocide (unless people started dying from the lack of water. Not sure about this point, though.) {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
### 2014 Four Arab Children on a Beach Incident:
1. There was an incident in 2014 where there were four Arabic children playing on a beach who were killed by an Israel drone attack. [^2]
2. There were no potential Hamas operatives in the area. [^2]
3. The kids were around 10 years old. [^2]
4. This attack occurred near a hotel where there were a lot of international press staying so the incident was widely covered. [^2]
	1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> An Israeli investigation found that the beach was used by Hamas naval commandos. Israel had previously struck that same beach as recently as the previous day. That part of the beach was specifically fenced off because it was being used for terrorist activity.[^2]
### “Lavender” and “Where’s Daddy”
1. Israel uses these programs to identify who is part of Hamas and who is not.
2. The program also gives some sort of suggestion for how to kill terrorists it discovers. It usually suggests doing this at night as it is easier to predict where terrorists will be at night. However, this leads to the death of the family who are sleeping in the same apartment. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source and I need to do more research on this</font>}
### Dahiya Doctrine
1. Israeli doctrine to respond with disproportionate response to attacks to dissuade future attacks. {<font color="#ff0000">I’m not sure if the point is to kill civilians as well to try to get the civilian population to turn on the terrorists using their village as a base of operations to target Israel, or if this takes the assumption that the village where the attacks are coming from have many terrorists as well as weapons and ammunitions stored there and so it is assessed as a military target worth taking out despite the civilian casualties. Also, is this doctrine still being used by Israel now?</font>}[^3]
	1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> Israel considers it worth it to kill the civilians to save the lives of Israeli civilians.
	2. <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">Counter:</span> Isn’t that basically what terrorism is? You attack innocent civilians for the sake of achieving political aims.
	3. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> Israel is attempting to save lives by doing this. Perhaps this can be compared to the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagisaki. Those bombings probably saved hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives.[^4] And this can be even more justified as these villages are launching attacks at Israel as opposed to Hiroshima and Nagisaki that were only tangentially involved in the war {<font color="#ff0000">I assume that there was production in those cities. I should find out if that is true.</font>}
	4. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> The people there likely support the attacks on Israel. (This is not a stand alone reason. It stands on top of another reason.)
### Killing Aid Workers

1. In the 2023 Gaza War, Israel has killed around 200 aid workers (by late March 2023).[^5]
	1. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> some of those aid workers were terrorists. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
	2. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Counter:</span> Hamas has used UNRWA buildings, hospitals, schools, and ambulances to hold and transport ammunition. That can reasonably lead to the death of aid workers. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
	3. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Possible counter:</span> What is the ratio of aid workers to civilian population? It might be much higher here than other places because of organizations like UNRWA which have a large presence. As such, if Israel deems that a certain attack has a reasonable ratio of damage to enemies versus civilians and goes ahead with it, it is more likely that some of those people are aid workers. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
	4. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> Aid workers have to be in communication with Israel about delivering aid, so Israel should know where the aid workers are and be able to avoid attacking them. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
	5. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Possible counter (to point 4):</span> That would only apply if Israel is consistently killing aid workers while they are delivering aid. If they are largely killed when they are not, this would not apply.
	6. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter (to point 5):</font> Israel has potentially attacked aid workers while they were delivering aid. See Israel attack on World Central Kitchen Workers and Flour Massacre.
### Definition of Terrorist
1. Israel has a relatively loose definition of “terrorist”. According to Israel, many people who are very tangentially involved in Hamas or have relatives involved in Hamas are considered to be terrorists. This makes a difference in terms of who Israel is counting when it says that it killed a certain number of terrorists. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
### ICJ (International Court of Justice) Case that Israel is Committing Genocide
1. South Africa has brought before the ICJ a case that Israel is committing genocide on 29 of December, 2023.[^6]
2. Africa was trying to get an immediate ceasefire. That did not happen. It is not so unusual for the court to issue that one side in a war is baseless. The ICJ in 2022 called for an immediate ceasefire by Russia in its war with Ukraine.[^7]
## Historical Claims:
### Menachem Begin Accepting Peace
1. People believe that Menachem Began accepted the '47 partition plan as a show, but he planned on expanding Israel anyway.[^8]
