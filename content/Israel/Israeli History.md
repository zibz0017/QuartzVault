# Scattered Migrations to Israel (Late 1700s — mid-1800s)
## Early People Moving to Israel
1. Around 300 Chassidish families made aliya in 1777.[^1]
2. 400 talmidim of the Gra made aliya in 1812.[^1]
## State of Jews in Israel at the Time
1. There were about 10,000 Jews living in Israel in the mid-1800s, Most of them lived in Jerusalem, but some lived in other cities.[^1]
2. Some cities may have had a tradition of Jewish settlement since Roman times.[^1] [^2]
3. Most of these Jews were immigrants from Poland and Lithuania.[^1]
4. They largely survived on charity from their original communities.[^1]
# Beginnings of Migration to Palestine (1850s - 1880s)
1. In 1862, Moshe Hess wrote a book called Rome and Jerusalem, connecting Jewish "nationality" with Israel and Jerusalem.[^1]
2. In 1870, Charles Natter founded an agricultural school in Israel.[^1]
## Nationality of Emigrants
1. Settlers were largely from Eastern Europe, such as Poland, Lithuania, Hungary, and Romania, Russia, and Arabic lands, such as Yemen.[^3] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Most immigrants, or at least an outsized percentage, may have been from Russia. I would like to check this up.</span>}
## Jerusalem
1. Many of the Jews immigrated to Jerusalem.[^3]
2. The Jews were the majority of the population in Jerusalem since the 1850s.[^3]
3. In 1889, there were about 25,000 Jews to 14,000 Arabs.[^3]
## Settlements
### Support
1. Settlements were largely agrarian[^3] and relied on outside funding.[^4]
### Hardships
1. Settlers faced a collection of hardships such as:
	1. Lack of food due to a lack of agricultural knowledge[^1] and poor land {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">need source</span>}.
	2. Harassment from nearby Arabs. For example, Arabs would sometimes graze their animals on the crops of the settlers.[^1]
	   There were some individual cases of more extreme violence, like Jews in Petach Tikva who were attacked by local Arabs in 1886[^5] and Avraham Yalofsky who was killed by Arabs from a neighboring village in 1888.[^3]
	3. Malaria. Some settlements were able to overcome this issue by draining swamps and planting eucalyptus trees (which repel mosquitos).[^3]
### First Settlements
#### Rosh Pina
1. Established in 1878.[^1]
3. Eventually the town was abandoned in 1880 due to the the usual [[#Hardships|hardships]].[^1]
4. The town was reestablished in 1882.[^1]
5. Baron Rothchild helped fund the town until they could get themselves financially stable.[^1]
6. They supported themselves by growing tabaco and mulberry trees for silkworms.[^1]
#### Petach Tikva
1. Established in 1878 (3 months after Rosh Pina).[^1][^6]
2. The land for the settlement was bought from a Greek landowner.[^1]
3. The settlers were faced with many hardships, such as poor hardships and Malaria.[^1][^6]
4. Eventually, the town was abandoned either in 1880-81[^7] or in 1882.[^1][^6]
5. At its peak, there were 10 homes and sixty-something people.[^1][^6]
6. The city was reestablished by people from the Bilu movement in 1883 with help from the Rothchilds to drain the swamp (to help get rid of the mosquitos which spread Malaria).[^1][^8]
## Russia and the First Aliya
### Movements pre-Zionism
1. Due to Russian pogroms, two Jewish Russian programs were formed in the early 80s: Bilu (which stand for בית יעקב לכו ונלכו) and Chovivei Tzion.[^1]
2. Bilu was secular.[^1] {<font color="#ff0000">I don't know whether Chovivei Tzion was as well</font>}
### The First Aliya
1. Most Jews leaving Russia at this time went to the U.S., Britain, Western Europe, and South Africa. Less than 2% went to Palestine.[^1]
2. Despite the small percentage, around 25,000 Jews emigrated to Israel between 1882 and 1903 (known as the First Aliya).[^1]
3. This was largely supported by the Rothchilds and agriculture in Palestine.[^1]
### Notable Occurences
1. Rishon Letzion was established in 1882.[^1][^9]
2. The poem of Hatikva was created during this time. It would be slightly adapted to be made into Israel's national anthem.[^1][^10]
## Perspective of Jews in Eastern Europe on Palestinian Jews
1. Most Jews outside of Palestine didn't know very much about the Jews in Palestine.[^3]
2. Some incorrectly thought that the Jews in Palestine were religious.[^3]
# Creation of Zionism
## Global Antisemitism
1. This was one of the main drivers for the creation of Zionism.[^3] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">It probably was also a big catalyst for Jews moving to Palestine earlier than this. I would like some examples of antisemitism and a source before I put it in the [[#Beginnings of Migration to Palestine (1850s - 1880s)]] section</span>}
### Examples
#### The Dreyfus Affair
1. A French army Captain named Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of treason for passing secrets on to Germany in 1894.[^11]
2. However, the trial was an obvious sham and Dreyfus was only convicted because of antisemitism.[^12]
3. Only after many years was he finally exonerated.[^13]
### How to Deal with Antisemitism
1. Jews dealt with antisemitism in a few ways:
	1. Assimilate.[^3]
	2. Push to create a socialist society where everyone is equal.[^3]
	3. Create a Jewish state with a Jewish government.[^3]
	4. (I don't think the frum people did any of these. I think they mostly shuttered themselves up, and then played politics and paid bribes and the like. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Need source</span>})
## Theodor Herzl
### Background
1. Was originally a journalist.[^3]
2. As mentioned before, he was largely inspired to create Zionism by the world-wide antisemitism. He was particularly affected by the antisemitism in Vienna, where he moved with his family and went to college.[^3]
### World Zionist Organization
1. Created in 1896. This was the in the age of "isms" (socialism, communism, etc. People were dreaming about and trying to create utopian societies.) As such, Zionism fit right in.[^3]
#### Goals
1. Have Jews to return to Palestine.[^3]
2. Jews would create their own society with their own government there.[^3]
3. Jews should feel a national identity and have a national home.[^3]
#### Herzl's Theoretical Description of this State
1. Democratic.[^3]
2. Have "Jewish values".[^3] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I don't know what exactly this means.</span>}
3. Secular.[^3]
4. Separation of church and state.[^3]
5. The state would not be isolated (like the Jews in Europe were isolated in their little shtetls). They would be involved in society around them.[^3]
6. This would end the Diaspora and make it impossible to happen again.[^3]
#### Spreading the Idea
1. Herzl went around Europe in 1996, spreading his ideas.[^3]
2. The non-frum Jewish masses were largely acceptant to his ideas.[^3]
3. However, the rich and the powerful (such as Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia (uncle of the Tsar) and Baron Rothchild, had lukewarm reactions.[^3]
4. Also, frum Jews were against Herzl. They felt that the ingathering of the Jews from galus would only happen with the coming of mashiach.[^3]
5. Even amongst the non-frum, some were concerned about the idea of creating a separate Jewish state. They thought that Jews should try to be successful in their current homelands.[^3]
6. Immigrants and prospective immigrants were also against the idea. They thought that a more slow and steady, settlement by settlement approach was the way to go. A state was too grandiose and would receive too much opposition from the Arabs and the Turks.[^3]
### Writings
1. In 1896, Herzl wrote *The Jewish State* where he wrote about his goals, description, and the creation of a Jewish State.[^3]
# Hebrew Language
1. in 1889, a committee came together to modernize and organize Hebrew for daily use.[^3]
