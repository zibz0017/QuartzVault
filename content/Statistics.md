# General Advice
1. Use common sense when looking at statistics. If it doesn’t make sense, there might be something to that.[^1]
2. If the mean is x, do not assume that a significant majority is x or more (or x or less).[^2]
3. Median can be a better measure for what the general population is like. Mean gets pulled by a few outliers. (For example, if you look at salaries in a company, the CEO and vice president may make the mean salary significantly higher than what most employees are getting.)[^3]
   It seems that usually, the median is a better metric for what people are trying to measure when they are using means. Like when you say you want to know what x is like for the average guy, you want a feel of what it is reasonable to expect for a sizable chunk of people in the population. You don’t usually want a theoretical average person that isn’t representative of actual people.[^4]
4. Mean is better for getting a picture of the total per person of the population (kinda the definition of mean. For example, an NBA roster might have a few superstars and a lot of role/bench players. Going with the median would make it seem that the team owners are not really paying anything when in reality, they are.)[^5]

5. Mean is needed for evaluating gambles (10% chance of winning $90, 90% chance of losing $10).
6. Look closely to see if the statistics being used actually back the claim. Sometimes, they may sound similar but the claim and the statistic are not the same thing.[^6] In fact, because they make the claim and then use the statistic, you might fill in the necessary assumptions to make sense of the use of the statistic to back up the claim, even though the statistic isn’t necessarily saying what you are prescribing to it.[^4]
   In addition, sometimes statistics can be used in tandem with other statistics and you once again fill in necessary assumptions that are simply not there. 
	1. <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> “The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPS) reported 300,000 complaints of mail theft in 2021, which doubled compared to the year before. According to FinCEN, banks reported a total of around 680,000 check frauds last year. This number increased from 350,000 reports the prior year.”[^7] The obvious assumption is that a lot of the check fraud represented in the 680,000 statistic are being stolen from the mail. (Because of the stats presented in tandem, and because the point of the article is to discuss checks being stolen in the mail (the article is titled “Still Mailing Checks in 2023? – Think Again!”)). However, that is not what the statistic says. All it says is that there were 300,000 complaints of mail theft, nearly all of which could have been packages or things like that. While it is reasonable to assume that a significant chunk of the stolen mail was checks, it is impossible to know how much.[^4]
7. The statistic itself might not be measuring what you think it is measuring.[^4]
	1. <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> The average salary of a company might include the fact that the owners are taking salaries. That is not what you would count as particularly compelling against a labor union, but if you just see a high average salary statistic, you might not realize what that includes (this is in addition to the potential problem of using means as discussed previously (although this case perhaps seems to qualify as one where mean is a useful metric, also as mentioned previously)).
8. Decimals look precise but that can be false (like a number based on a mean of some data which wasn’t gathered accurately).
9. Sometimes it makes sense to discuss the percentage increase (1 to 2 is a %100 increase). Sometimes it makes sense to use absolute values (1 to 2 is an increase of 1). {<font color="#ff0000">Need to think about when each one would make sense</font>}[^8]
