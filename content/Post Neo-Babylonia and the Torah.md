*Babylonia, Persia, the Greeks, and Macedonia*

# Basic History According to the Torah
*As presented in Artscroll footnote 25 on Rosh Hashanah 3a*
{<font color="#ff0000">Need to put in the years that at least some of these things occurred</font>}
1. Daryaveish Hamadi (Darius the Mede) conquered Babyonia from Belshazzar. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source. I think this is in the beginning of Daniel</font>} ^b9ec35
2. He is succeeded by Koresh (Cyrus the Great).[^1]
3. In the 1st year of his reign, he allowed the Jews to return to Eretz Yisroel and rebuild the Beis Hamikdash.[^2][^3]
4. Jews do this under Zerubavel.
5. The non-Jews write defamatory letters about the Jews and get “King Artachshashtah” to stop the construction.[^4] 
   It is not clear who this king is. “Artachshashtah'' is a generic name for “king” in Persia (like Pharoh in Mitzrayim). This could be Koresh,[^5] his successor Achashveirosh[^6] or a king between them.[^7] (I don’t know how this last opinion fits with Seder Olam. I don’t think Seder Olam has a king between Koresh and Achasveirosh. Also, is this king mentioned anywhere else?)
6. Daryaveish Hamadi and Koresh rule for a combined 4 years.[^8][^9]
7. Achashveirosh comes to power. He also receives negative reports about the Jews and so he bans construction on the Beis Hamikdash.[^10][^11]
8. Purim happens.
9. Achashveirosh rules for 14 years.[^8][^12]
10. Daryaveish Haparsi (Darius the Great) ascends to the throne.
11. In the second year of his rule, Chagai and Zachariah have a nevuah that the Jews should work on the Beis Hamikdash without official permission.[^13][^14] ^d227be
12. Daryaveish investigates and finds the original proclamation of Koresh allowing construction, and so he allows the construction.[^15]
13. The Beis Hamikdash is completed in year 6 of Daryaveish’s reign in Adar.[^16]
14. Ezra comes to Yerushalaym a year and a half later.[^17]
15. He has proclamations from the king to get resources from the goyim to help build the Beis Hamikdash.[^18]
16. Artachshashtah in this part is Daryaveish[^19]
17. In the 20th year of Artachshashta, Nechemia received word that conditions in Yerushalayim are very bad and the walls of the city have been destroyed. So Nechemia gets money from the king to help rebuild the walls.[^20]
18. 52 years after Daryaveish Hamadi defeated the Babylonians ([[#^b9ec35|this]])[^21] and 34 years and construction on the Beis Hamikdash is begun by Zecharia and Chagai ([[#^d227be|this]]),[^22] Persian rule over Eretz Yisroel comes to an end with the Greeks taking over.[^23][^24]
19. According to secular historians, the Persian empire lasted about 169 years more and had many more kings.

## Dating Years of King’s Rule
1. The last year of a king's rule is attributed to the next king. Meaning, if a king began his rule in the middle of year 500 and died at some point in the middle of year 495, in historical records he will be recorded as ruling from 500-496, a total of 5 years.[^25]
## Basic History
1. Alexander conquered Persia in 331 and ruled until 323 BC. ^d791db
2. Philip 323 - 317.
3. Antigonus 317 - 311.
4. Seleucus I 311 - 281.
5. Antiochus I (not of the Chanukah story. That is much later) 281 - 261.
6. Antiochus II 261 - 246.
7. Seleucus II 246 - 225.
## Ancient Sources
1. Babylonian star diary.[^25]
2. A king list recorded by Ptolemy (lived around the 2nd century C.E.).[^25]
3. Cuneiform tablets with decrees and things like that, dated with the year of the current king.[^25]

## Challenges

### Did Alexander Rule for 8 Years
1. In 311, the Greeks began a new counting system (meaning, this is now considered to be year 1).[^25]
2. According to the secular system, this works out nicely. This was the first year of rule for Seleucus.[^25]
3. According to the Uruk king list, Alexander the Great ruled for 7 years, not 8 [[#^d791db|like is generally thought]].[^25] ^ace4b0
4. In addition, there are only cuneiform tablets found with dates for 7 years of Alexander’s reign.[^25]
5. This is crucial because if Alexander only ruled for 7 years and the reigns of Philip and  Antigonus remain the same (as they do according to the Uruk King List), then that means that Seleucus begins his reign in 310. That leaves us with the question of what happened in year 311 that was so special to begin a new counting system.[^25]
### Reign of Seleucus I
1. According to conventional history, Seleucus died in the 6th month in his 31st year off reign. According to the Uruk King List, he ruled a full 31 years and died in the 10th month in the 32nd year of reign.[^25]
2. The Uruk King List version is backed up by a cuneiform tablet that dates to the 32nd year and 10 month of Seleucus’s reign.[^25] ^08eb82
### Reign of Antiochus I
1. According to conventional history, Antiochus I ruled 20 years. According to the Uruk King List, he ruled 22 years.[^25]
## Responses
1. Perhaps there were some scribal errors in the Uruk King List as well as the [[#^08eb82|cuneiform tablet mentioned]].[^28]
2. Perhaps the month that the year began was different in different places and at different times which could have led to different years being attributed to different rulers. For example, if one ruler ruled for 14 months, then historically, it would probably be counted that this ruler ruled for one year (with the 2nd year of the reign being counted for the next ruler). But if the rule began in the last month of the year and, then perhaps it can be counted as ruling for two years (with the 1st month making the whole year count as part of this ruler's reign, as well as the next twelve months).[^28]
   This does take the assumption that years were not totally based on the ruler, meaning that the year restarted when a new ruler took over. This would seem to be true as historians seem to try to figure out which years (as we know them) rulers ruled for. This would be impossible if the year restarted (like if a ruler ruled for 18 months and then the next ruler ruled for 18 months, that would be three years in real time but only be counted as each ruler ruling for one year in the historical records).[^28]
   This explanation would not explain the [[#Reign of Antiochus I|reign of Antiochus I]] problem as there is a two year discrepancy. As such, this response would have to rely on previous point.[^28]
   It doesn't appear that historians are bothered by most of these discrepancies as is implied from the note [here](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/uruk-king-list/#:~:text=7%27-,MU%2022note,-mAn%2Dti) as this point is the only point described as a scribal error.[^28]
## Consistency with Chazal
1. If we start Alexander's reign from 318 BCE, consistent with Seder Olam {<font color="#ff0000">need to add link</font>}, and then count his rule as seven years [[#^ace4b0|like the Uruk King List]] we arrive at Alexander's reign coming to a close in year 311 BCE, which would explain why year 311 was a significant year. The rulership was being passed and the kingdom was divided at this time according to Chazal.[^25]
2. According to the Babylonian dream diaries {<font color="#ff0000">not clear on this point. Need to go back and check</font>} a ruler "Antiochus" died in year 246 BCE. Conventional chronology assumes that this is Antiochus II. However, perhaps this is really Antiochus I. Using 318 as the starting year for Alexander as well as using the Uruk King List, this would line up as is displayed in the [[#^02a3ff|table]] (the years being discussed have been bolded).[^25]
### Realigning Conventional History with Chazal
1. Conventional history and Chazal can realign by the end of the reign of Seleucus II.[^25]
2. If you take the assumption that Antiochus II and Seleucus II had a coregency  (meaning, they both ruled at the same time) then the end of the reign of Seleucus II would be the same year according to Chazal and the conventional chronology as displayed in the [[#^02a3ff|table]].[^25]
#### Indications for a Coregency
1. There were multiple capital cities in Babylonia at this time.[^25]
2. Seleucus II had a brother named Antiochus.[^25]
3. Egypt successfully invaded around this time. Seleucus II had a half brother through his mother (the sister of Ptolemy III, the pharoh of Egypt) who was named Antiochus. Perhaps Antiochus was installed as a ruler by Ptolemy III as a coregent with Seleucus II.[^25]
### Challenges
1. It does seem a bit odd that this coregency is not mentioned in any of the king lists mentioned (including the Uruk King List).[^28]
2. Is it strange that there were multiple "capital cities" under one ruler?[^28] {<font color="#ff0000">Need example of other empires with multiple capital cities under one ruler</font>}
3. It seems that historians assume that Seleucus II's father was Antiochus II. In addition, historians seems to think that Antiochus, the half-brother of Selecus II was killed before ever becoming the ruler. [^29][^30]{<font color="#ff0000">Need to see why they think this. Is it only because of the king lists or are there more reasons</font>}

# Achashverosh (Ahasuerus)
1. Comes up in Megillas Esther, Ezra, and Nechemia.
## Mefarshim
1. Rashi and the Gra say that he was a king under Cyrus the Great (Koresh).[^32] The reason they say this is because there was no time for him to rule. Cyrus ruled until the end of that גלות and the story was obviously in גלות so it couldn't be after Cyrus. Before Cyrus was Darius I (secular historians aren’t sure who this is.[^33]) and Darius’s father wasn’t a king. In addition, the megillah specifically mentions his kingdom, so it sounds like it is trying to preclude the other Achashverosh[^34] (I am confused by what the sifsei chachomim meant the father of Darius not being a king because he also implies that the Achashverosh of the purim story ruled from Hodu to Kush as opposed to the other Achashverosh who only ruled over Persia and Media. In addition, the Evven Ezra calls him a king [1st Evven Ezra after his introduction]. Maybe he just meant that he wasn’t a king over from Hodu to Kush).
    
2. However, in Ezra 4:6, Rashi says that the Achashverosh over there is the same one in the Megillah and he reigned after Cyrus [[Rashi](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.4.6?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en)]. (I think it might not be clear if Rashi on Ezra is actually Rashi). {Need source}
    
3. Rashi on 4:7 also says that כרש, דריוש and ארתחששתא are really the same person, quoting Rosh Hashanah 3b and that ארתחששתא is really the name for Persian emperors (like Pharoh in Egypt). [[Rashi](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.4.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en)] (Not sure how this fits with the fact that Darius was the father of Cyrus as we said in point i.)
    
4. The Evven Ezra seems to learn that he ruled after Koresh (not sure what he does with the sifsei chachamim’s point). He says that he is ארתחששתא (Secular scholars think this is Artaxerxes I but the mefarshim there [[Rashi](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.4.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en), [Malbim](https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.4.7?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en)] say that he is Cyrus. I’m not sure if he is saying that this is one pshat or 2 separate pshatim. Overall, I had a hard time reading the piece). [1st Evven Ezra after his introduction]
    

## Secular view

1. The general consensus is that he is Xerxes [[Jewish Virtual Library : Ahasuerus](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ahasuerus), [Wikipedia : Ahasuerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahasuerus)]. However, some say he is Artaxerxes I and others think he is Artaxerxes II. [[Wikipedia : Ahasuerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahasuerus)]
    

### Reasons to think he is Xerxes:

1. Transliteration of his name through different languages (Persian to Babylonian to Hebrew).
    
2. Events in the Megillah, such as Xerxes’s love of women, and a capital at Susa (Shushan. Although the capital was already there from the days of Cambyses and Darius built a massive palace there [[WorldHistory.org : Susa](https://www.worldhistory.org/susa/)]) (the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahasuerus) has 2 more points but I don’t really see how they are so indicative of anything.
    
3. He had an unofficial member of the court named Marduka, who is, perhaps Mordechai. [[Wikipedia : Ahasuerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahasuerus)]
    

Counter: The Babylonians had a god named marduk so Marduka may not have been an uncommon name. Also, it sounds strange that Mordechai would go by the name of an avodah zara. [Own thoughts]

## Extent of Empire

1. The Megillah says he ruled from Hodu to Kush. This would be consistent with the rulership of nearly every Persian ruler beginning with Cambyses assuming Hodu is India and Kush is the Kingdom of Kush, south of Egypt.
    
2. The only exceptions might be Artaxerxes II, who lost Egypt in a revolution at the beginning of his reign (402 BC. He started ruling in 404/405 BC) and he never reconquered it [[Wikipedia : Artaxerxes II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artaxerxes_II)], and Darius III who lost his entire empire to Alexander the Great [[Wikipedia : Cambyses II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_II), [Wikipedia : Darius the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great), [WorldHistory : Persian Empire Map](https://www.worldhistory.org/image/148/achaemenid-empire-map/), [Wikimedia : Persian Empire](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Achaemenid_Empire.gif)]
