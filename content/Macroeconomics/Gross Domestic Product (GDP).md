*Note: Unless otherwise indicated, GDP refers to [[#Real GDP|real GDP]], not [[#Nominal GDP|nominal GDP]].*
# Basic Definition
1. The market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country, in a year.[^1]
# Explanation
## Market Value
1. The item has to be bought and sold to have a market value.[^1]
2. As such, charitable work, domestic work (like babysitting your child or mowing your lawn), free goods and services, and things without a price (like if a polar bear is born is a zoo) do not count toward GDP.[^1]
3. This does not mean that these things are not valuable and are not good. Being counted or not being counted toward GDP has nothing to do with that.[^1]
4. The reason why this is because it is difficult to calculate how much these things are worth.[^1] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I'm not sure how that applies to everything that is not bought or sold as many of these things have a relatively set price, such as babysitting, for example.</span>}
## Finished Goods, Intermediate Goods, and Capital Goods
1. Things bought by a final consumer are included in GDP.[^1]
2. Things bought by someone to be made into something else and sold are called "intermediate goods" and are not included in GDP.[^1]
3. Things bought by someone as a tool to create something that will be sold is called a "capital good" and is included in GDP.[^1]
	<span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Examples:</span>
	1. A person buys some eggs to make an omelet. The eggs are a finished good and are included in GDP.
	 2. A baker buys some eggs to make a cake to sell in his store. The eggs are intermediate goods and are not counted toward GDP. The cake is, though.
	 3. A farmer buys a tractor to help grow crops. This tractor is a capital good and is counted toward GDP, even thought the tractor is used by the farmer to grow crops that are sold.
## Services
1. Services are included in GDP.[^1]
   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> A plumber comes to your house to fix some pipes and charges you for it. This is included in GDP.
## Within a Country
1. Things which are imported from a country count toward the exporting country's GDP, not the importing country's.[^1]
   {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">How do we evaluate a product which was partially assembled in different countries? Which country gets the GDP of that product?</span>}
## Produced Within a Year
1. If something was produced before a given year and then sold, it does not count toward the GDP of the year it was sold.[^1]
   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> An old house was sold. This does not count toward GDP of the year that it was sold in, as it was not produced within that year.
   {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">If the house was never sold before, then maybe it does count. Practically, you only know how much the house is worth from how much it was sold for, so until it is sold, it may not count toward GDP. I'm not sure about this point.</span>}
# Nominal GDP vs Real GDP, and GDP per Capita
1. GDP generally changes for three reasons:
	1. A country produces more stuff.[^2]
	2. A country produces better stuff.[^2] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Although if a country finds a way to produce the same thing for less money, that would seem to count against its GDP.</span>}
	3. [[Inflation]].[^2]
## Nominal GDP
1. Nominal GDP measures all three points.[^2]
## Real GDP
1. Real GDP measures the first two points.[^2]
2. Real GDP is usually the more important figure as it is used to see if a country actually produced more goods and services.[^2]
   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> Country A produces a lot more in one year than in the previous year, and Country B produces the same as it always does but has high levels of inflation. The nominal GDP of the two countries will be similar, but the Real GDP will not be. Using the real GDP, we can actually see that one of these countries is actually producing more and the other is not.
## GDP per Capita
1. It is important to measure the GDP per capita (per person) as opposed to just regular GDP as this gives a clearer picture of the production of a country.[^2]
   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> A country's GDP stays stable over time. However, the population grows. This would indicate that the country is producing less per person, and that each person has less.
## Coming Together
1. Combining what has been said, to get a measure of a country's level of production, one looks at the real GDP per capita.[^2]
### Recession
1. When the real GDP per capita shrinks, that is usually a sign that we are in a recession.[^2]
   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> In 2009 (one year in The Great Recession) the real GDP per capita shrunk by 3.43%.[^3]
# Calculating GDP
## National Spending Approach
1. Calculates GDP by calculating the amount of money spent.[^4]
2. GDP is divided into 4 parts:
	1. Consumption (things that everyday people buy, like groceries and plane tickets).[^4]
	2. Investment (things generally bought by businesses, like tractors and computers).[^4]
	3. Government spending (which can include things for the office work of government, like computers, or military spending, like tanks).[^4]
	   Unemployment, social security, and other government programs are not included in GDP. This is because this is just a redistribution of money, not money being used to purchase a good or a service. When they are spent by the people who receive them, then they are included in GDP.[^4]
	4. Net exports (meaning the amount we export minus the amount we import).[^4]
3. Generally, in the U.S. the breakdown is something like 63% for consumption, and government spending slightly more than investment. Net exports is about zero (meaning, we export and import about the same amount).[^4]
4. When we refer to GDP, we generally refer to this approach of calculating the GDP.[^4]
## Factor Income Approach
1. Calculates GDP by calculating the amount of money earned.[^4]
2. GDP is divided into:
	1. Employee compensation (salaries and benefits).[^4]
	2. Rent.[^4]
	3. Interest.[^4]
	4. Profit.[^4]
3. Generally referred to as Gross Domestic Income (GDI).[^4]
## Why We Use Both Methods
1. While theoretically GDP and GDI should be come out to exactly the same, because of some slight mistakes, they come out to be slightly different.[^4]
2. As such, one or the other may have some indication toward the a future economic turn before the other. Therefore, it can be useful to look at both measures.[^4]
3. Another reason it is useful to look at both measures, particularly, the factors that go into the measures is that depending on which factors are increasing or decreasing, there are different economic tools that can be used to combat a negative turn.[^4]
# Why GDP Per Capita Is Important
1. Real GDP per capital is correlated with many important metrics, such as:
	1. life expectancy.[^5]
	2. Happiness.[^5]
	3. Education. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Need source</span>}
	4. Average income.[^6]
	   It is important to keep in mind that this is just an average, meaning, that in one country, most people can be pretty well off, while in another, most people are poor, with a small class of mega-rich people.[^5]
	5. Average income amongst poor people (meaning, it's not that the rich people of the countries are gaining all the wealth in the high GDP per capita countries. The poor people in high GDP per capital countries are more wealthy on average than their counterparts in countries with low GDP per capita.)[^5]
# Comparing GDP in Different Countries
1. Sometimes, from an American, we think of all non-first-world countries as poor. However, this is obviously wrong.
   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> The GDP per capital in Mexico is about 30% of the GDP per capital in the US in 2024, but is still about 23 times higher than the GDP per capita in the Central African Republic.[^7]
## Quality of Life Today vs Historically
{<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Not sure if this section belongs here exactly. I have to figure out where to put this.</span>}
1. Even countries the lowest GDP per capita today are doing better than many countries in years past in a variety of ways, such as:
	1. Life expectancy.
	   <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Example:</span> In 2024, Nigeria was the country with the lowest life expectancy,[^8] at 54 years.[^9] In 1820, the average life expectancy in the countries with the highest life expectancy was just over 40 years.[^10]
	   This is because of things increased technology which led to better access to food and clean drinking water, as well as advances in sanitation and medical care.[^11]
# GDP Growth
1. GDP in the United States has grown at a steady rate since the 1800s: about 2% a year.[^11]
## Rule of 70
1. A good way to estimate how long it will take for a
