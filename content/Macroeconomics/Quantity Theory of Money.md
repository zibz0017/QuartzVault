# Formula
1. M \* V = P \* Y
2. M = Money in an economy.
   V = Velocity (amount of times a dollar is on average over a period of time (usually a year)).
   P = Average price level (inflation). {<font color="#ff0000">Need to link this to the article with GDP</font>}
   Y = Real GDP. {<font color="#ff0000">Need to link this to the article with GDP</font>}
# Explanation
1. Basically, this means that the amount of stuff bought (the left side of the equation. The amount of money there is multiplied by how many times that money was spent) equals the amount of stuff sold (the right side of the equation. The value of everything produced multiplied by the inflation level).[^1]
2. Both side are equivalent to nominal GDP.[^1] {<font color="#ff0000">Need to link this to the article with GDP</font>}
3. While this seems rather obvious, this formula can be used to help understand things in an economy,[^1]
# Characteristics of the Different Variables (in the US Economy)
1. Over time, velocity stays stable, usually between 6 and 8. {<font color="#ff0000">not sure which video this is from</font>}
2. Y increases by around 2% a year. {<font color="#ff0000">not sure which video this is from</font>}
3. An increase in M is usually caused by the government printing money. {<font color="#ff0000">not sure which video this is from</font>}
## Relationship Between Variables
1. In the short term, an increase in P might be because of an increase in M or a decrease in Y. As stated before, though, Y generally increases, so a rise in P is because of a rise in M.
