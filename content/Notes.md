- One needs to destroy their chametz to be mekayem the mitzva of tashbisu.[^1]
- The preferable method for destroying chametz is by burning it. This is because according to one shitah, we learn the destruction of chametz from the destruction of nossar, which was done through burning. This is certainly so if one finds chametz after the zman issur {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">link to that</span>} or on yom tov itself.[^2] (meaning that at this point, the person is not able to be mefkir the chametz as discussed {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">link to that</span>} and so one has to especially makpid to destory the chametz.)
- When one burns chametz, it needs to be burned down to coal[^3] (or ash, I assume).
- One can also crumble the chametz up and toss it to the wind (make sure that the chametz is small enough that if one finds it they will not get hanah from it)[^4] or throw it to the sea. If one does throw it into the sea, they should make sure to crumble it up, especially if it is something hard, like stale bread, which may not break down in the water so easily.[^5]
- One can also mix chametz with something disgusting, like feces.[^6]
- However, one may not do this in front of a pig as the pig does not mind digging through the feces to eat the chametz and one would be getting hanah from the chametz. One may put it in feces even if the mixture will eventually end up in front of a pig.[^6]
  It would seem from here that even though we say that mixing chametz with something disgusting makes it as if it is destroyed from the world, this is not if it is set up to give one hanah by doing this (like in the case where one puts the chametz in front of a pig). If it is more indirect (like in the case where it would only eventually be brought in front of the pig) then it would be fine.[^7]
- (As said, before, burning the chametz is the preferred method)
- It is preferable to burn the chametz in the day.[^8] This is because:
	1. Burning the chametz is learned from nossar, as discussed.[^8] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">link to that</span>}
	2. This is a reminder to do the second bittul.[^9]
- One should make sure to burn the chametz in the fifth hour so they have time to be mevatel the chametz before the sixth hour (because at that point it is too late, as discussed {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">link to that</span>})[^9]
- One has a chiyuv of tashbisu beginning 30 days before the chag. As such, if someone destroys the chametz within 30 days before, they fulfill their mitzvah of tashbisu.[^10] This is especially true if someone wants to destroy their chametz right after the bedika because they are nervous that the chametz may get scattered from where they have it hidden away.[^8]
- If someone has hoshanos from sukkos, they should burn it with the chametz as since the hoshanos have already been used in a mitzva, it is proper to use them to be mekayeim another mitzva.[^9]

- The Torah records the tremendous nissim that Hashem did to strengthen our emunah.[^11]
---
- At least according to some shitos, even though klal yisroel needed to accept peace with the Canaanim if they were willing to accept upon themselves certain things (at least according to some shitos), it was preferable for them not to accept up themselves these things and then fight and get destroyed by klal yisroel. This is because:
	1. Hashem wanted to punish them for their chataim.[^12][^13]
	2. They would get Klal Yisroel to sin.[^12][^13]
---
- It is a machlokes if one has a slave that they are responsible for their food, may they pay the slave enough chametz before Pesach to cover the whole chiyuv of food that will come on Pesach. The Mishna Berura seems to be meikel.[^14]
- However, may not explicitly tell the slave to keep the chametz for Pesach because then one is getting hanah from chametz on Pesach. Rather, one would just give it to the slave and not mention that the slave should keep it around until Pesach.[^14] (It seems that since this was the owner's chametz, even though it is not his chametz anymore, it is still assur to cause it to give him hanah. This would be similar to what we say that one should not throw chametz by the time of biur into one's fish tank, because they would be benefiting from chametz after the zman issur.[^15] I assume that the reason is the same: even though one is mevatel the chametz, they are stil benefiting from the chametz after the zman of issur.)
- Also, the slave should not eat the chametz in the house of the master if the slave decides to eat the chametz on Pesach as this looks like the master paid the slave the chametz on Pesach, which is assur.[^14]
- (Does this perhaps also apply to a modern day cleaning lady or some other kind of employee that receives their lunch from their employer? Meaning, that one may give their employee enough chametz to satisfy all the lunches that they owe their employee over Pesach, before Pesach? Keep in mind that even if this is correct, the employee should not eat the chametz in the house of the employer.[^7])
- If one gives all their chametz to a goy, they are not mekayem the mitzva of tashbisu (although they this is effective for not being ovver on bal yeiraeh). As such, one should keep at least a kezayis of chametz so can be mekayem tashbisu.[^16]
- One may get hana from the coals or the ashes of the chametz if one burned the chametz before the zman issur.[^17] (Similar to what was said before about being allowed to put chametz into feces even if it will eventually end up in front of a pig and it will eat the chametz.)
- If one destroys the chametz after the zman issur, then one cannot get hana from the coals or ashes.[^17]

- Shmuess: According to the Ralbag, Klal Yisroel defeated the nations of Canaan because of the zechus of Klal Yisroel and because Hashem promised the avos that He would give Eretz Yisroel to the Klal Yisroel (I think that the lashon didn't sound like it was in the zechus of the avos per se; it was more that Hashem promised them). It was not particularly in the zechus of Moshe Rabbeinu.[^18]
- We see the tremendous power of the zechusim of Klal Yisroel. Now, this was the children of the Dor Deiah, so they were on a madreiga much higher than ours (although you can counter that they were "going up against" the zechusim of Moshe Rabbeinu, who is obviously far greater than anyone else). And we obviously are not saying that the zechusim the gedolim doesn't make much of a difference, because it obviously does. Yet we see that the zechus of Klal Yisroel at large is very potent; potentially more potent than the zechusim of the gedolim of the generation.[^7]
- *I never actually presented this shmuz to my chabura or to a rebbi. Also, I'm not sure if this qualifies as a shmuz in the sense that the maareh makom might already be saying this explicitly.*
---
- Possible Shmuess that needs work: According to the Mincha Ketana, certain leshonos were used in Sefer Yehoshua regarding Moshe conquering territory vs Yehoshua conquering territory. He explains that the reason for this is that Moshe conquered the land selflessly as he didn't have a cheilek in the land (I assume this was because he was going to die before going into the land, although perhaps it was because he was a Levi and they didn't receive land. If it is the second pshat, this might knock out the shmuz, so I would have to prove that it has to be the first pshat), but Yehoshua did have a cheilek and so there was some selfishness, at least to some degree.
- This is interesting to me because Yehoshua knew that he was going to die after conquering the land. So what does it mean that he there was some degree of selfishness? It would seem that it is only very slight. You can say that perhaps this means that he conquered the land for his children, although this would seem to apply to Moshe Rabbeinu as well. Perhaps you can differentiate, though, because while Moshe conquered some land, he did not necessarily conquer the land where his children were going to live.
