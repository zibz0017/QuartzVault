*Note: Lithuania in this article refers to both Lithuania and Belarus*
# Lithuanian History
1. See [[Jewish History in Poland#General Polish History|General Polish History]] and [[Jewish History in Poland#Jewish-Focused Polish History|Jewish-Focused Polish History]] as Lithuania had a very similar history to Poland.
2. By the time the 1900s rolled around, if you were not in a yeshiva, you were not frum. (There were a few exceptions to this, such as Rav Moshe and the Chazon Ish, but for the overwhelming majority, this was the case.)[^1]
# Temperament of the People
1. Lithuanians were more intellectual and calm personalities (a קאַלט ליטװאַק) compared to the Polish people who were more emotional (obviously, this is a large generalization.)[^2]
2. This fit with their modes of development: Poland had many Chassiduses while Lithuania had many great yeshivos.[^2]
# Belarus Chassidus
1. There were a few Chassiduses which were actually started in Belarus, such as Lubavitch, Karlin (now spelled Karolin), and Slonim.[^2]
2. These Chassiduses actually have a focus on learning, so they fit with the [[#Temperament of the People|general temperament of the people there]].[^2]
# Yeshivos of Lithuania
## Volozhin
### Creation of the Yeshiva
1. Volozhin was started sometime between 1803 and 1807, by Rav Chaim Volozhiner.[^3][^4]
2. Rav Chaim Volozhiner asked the Gra about starting a yeshiva and the Gra was against it. Rav Chaim Volozhiner started the yeshiva after the Gra was nifter. It is not known what changed after the Gra was nifter that made Rav Chaim decide the right thing was to open the yeshiva.[^3]
### Continuation of the Yeshiva
#### The Effect of the Haskala
{<font color="#ff0000">I think that most of this section ocured during the time of the Netziv, but I'm not sure</font>}
1. The maskilim tried to "modernize" Judaism and they saw the yeshiva as a threat to their movement.[^5]
2. The maskilim tried making their own competing schools. However, they were abject failures, obviously in Yiddishkeit, but even in terms of education.[^3]
3. As such, they tried to shut down the yeshiva.[^3]
4. One maskil {<font color="#ff0000">he might have been a talmid of the yeshiva. I need to check</font>} forged a letter making it seem like the Netziv was involved with the British government {<font color="#ff0000">I'm not sure if that is exactly correct but some sort of incriminating letter</font>}. The Netziv was brought in for questioning and was released when they ascertained what happened.[^3]
5. In addition, many of the talmidim in the yeshiva were "closet maskilim" (they were maskilim but kept it hidden). There is a memoir from someone in Volozhin who describes the great lengths that some talmidim went through to be able to read maskil books.[^3]
6. One thing the maskilim tried to do consistently was to get the government to pass laws that would severely impede the yeshiva's ability to give Torah.[^3]
7. They got the government to force the yeshiva to give secular subjects.[^3]
8. They yeshiva sort-of complied. They had some secular subjects given to a few talmidim in a side room.[^3]
#### The Roshei Yeshiva and Other Gedolim in the Yeshiva
##### Rav Itzelle
1. Rav Chaim was nifter in 1820.[^3]
2. Rav Chaim's son, Rav Itzelle took over the yeshiva.[^3]
3. Rav Itzelle was a tremendous talmid chacham of his father's caliber. As such, he was accepted as the new rosh yeshiva.[^3]
4. In 1840, he was involved in dealing with the czar, trying to have some influence on the decrees the czar was issuing.[^3]
5. He was nifter in 1849.[^3][^6]
##### Rav Eliezer Yehuda Fried
1. After Rav Itzelle, it was unclear who should take over. {<font color="#ff0000">I don't know why Rav Itzelle's son didn't take over</font>}\
2. He has multiple sons-in-law who were fit to take the position and it wasn't clear which one should take over.[^3]
3. Rav Eliezer Yehuda Fried became the rosh yeshiva and the Netziv (also a son-in-law of Rav Itzelle) became the assistant rosh yeshiva.
4. This remained until Rav Fried was nifter in 1854.[^7]
##### The Netziv (Rav Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin)
###### Kochos
1. The Netziv was not particularly gifted at learning when he was younger.[^3]
2. Even when he was older, his strength was that he was a tremendous masmid and incredible worker.[^3]
###### In the Yeshiva
1. There was a din Torah between the Netziv and the Beis Halevi (who was a great-grandson of Rav Chaim Volozhiner) about who should become the next rosh yeshiva.[^8] In the end, the Netziv won.[^9]
2. The Beis Halevi was appointed as the Netziv's assistant rosh yeshiva.[^3][^10] He remained in that roll until 1865 when he became the rav of Slutsk.
3. He remained rosh yeshiva until the yeshiva closed in 1892.[^3][^11]
4. When the Netziv was getting older, he brought it his son, Rav Chaim Berlin, to be the assistant.[^3]
5. People viewed Rav Chaim Berlin as too frum, and so they redoubled their efforts to close the yeshiva. Unfortunately, they were successful.[^3]
6. The Netziv ended up as the longest serving rosh yeshiva of Volozhin.[^10]
###### Sefarim
1. <span class="hebrew">העמק שאלה</span>: A pirush on שאילתות דרב אחאי גאון. The sefer is hard to understand so the sefer became obscure. This sefer made it easier to understand and brought it out of obscurity.[^3]
2. <span class="hebrew">העמק דבר</span>: The Netziv gave a weekly parsha shiur (which was a minhag in the yeshiva since Rav Chaim). The shiur was recorded and compiled in this sefer.[^3]
###### View on Learning Secular Subjects
1. The Netziv was not so opposed to learning secular subjects per se. He felt that for those for whom Torah was not going to be his parnasa.[^3]
2. However, he only hired non-Jewish teachers as the only Jewish people who could teach secular subjects were maskilim. He felt that goyim would be fine teaching and leaving "haskafa" out of it, while a maskil would not be willing to "slip in" some "hashkafa".[^3]
3. Also, the Netziv did not think that it should be part of a yeshiva.[^3]
##### Rav Chaim Brisker
1. Rav Chaim Brisker was joined Volozhin in 1880 and stayed until it closed in 1892.[^3][^12]
2. It was during this time that the whole "[[General Hashkafa#Change in Learning Style (Rav Chaim Brisker)|Brisker mehalech]]" in learning was disseminated.[^3]
3. Many gedolim in the following generation, such as Rav Baruch Ber Leibowitz, [[#Rav Shimon Shkop]], Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, and [[#Rav Elchonon|Rav Elchonon Wasserman]], adopted, or at least incorporated, Rav Chaim's style of learning.[^3]
### Description of the Yeshiva
1. Volozhin had no set limud. Everyone would learn whatever they wanted.[^3]
2. There was an optional shiur in the afternoon. The shiur began in Brachos and went through Niddah.[^3]
3. Despite this, the yeshiva was a unit in the sense that there was a קול תורה.[^3]
4. There was a rosh yeshiva who would go around and answer everyone's questions. The rosh yeshiva had to have shas on his fingertips.[^3]
### Effect of Volozhin
1. As discussed, you have the sefarim of the Netziv that were written. You also have Rav Chaim Brisker's style of learning.[^3]
#### Creation of Yeshivos
##### Pre Volozhin
1. Before Volozhin, yeshivos were largely built around a specific talmid chacham. Part of the salary of the rav would include a stipend for a few talmidim.[^1]
2. These yeshivos were tied to that gadol. When that gadol was niftir, the yeshiva was no more.[^1]
3. These yeshivos would remain rather small. As such, these yeshivos were unable to have a wider impact on klal yisroel.[^1]
4. To go to a yeshiva required mesiras nefesh. One was largely self-motivated to go to a yeshiva. Over time, this was being done less and less.[^3]
5. There may have been some exceptions to this, such as the [[Jewish History in Poland#^f7cb43|the yeshiva established by Rav Shalom Shachne]].
##### Volozhin and Post-Volozhin
1. Volozhin (as well as the later yeshivos) was a large yeshiva with many talmidim. This helped spread Torah to the masses as well as made it easier for people to go to yeshiva as it became more of a thing to do.[^1]
2. The yeshiva was set up to outlast Rav Chaim.[^1]
3. The yeshiva was funded by klal yisroel at large, rather than remain as a small, community funded entity.[^3]
### Closing the Yeshiva
1. Eventually the haskala got the government to pass very extreme laws that severely limited the amount of time that learning Torah could be done in yeshiva, forced there to be a tremendous amount of learning secular subjects, and required teachers to have decrees (which would mean that only maskilim could be teachers).[^3]
2. The Netziv decided that it was better to close the yeshiva rather than run the yeshiva this way, and so the yeshiva closed in 1892. This devastated the Netziv personally[^3] and he was nifter in 1893.[^13]
## Kletsk-Slutsk
### Creation of Slutsk
1. Kletsk was a branch of the yeshiva that started in Slutsk.[^3]
2. Rav Yaakov Dovid Willovsky (the Ridvaz) who was the rav in Slutsk, realized the necessity of yeshivos and so he reached out to the Alter of Slabodka.[^14]
3. The Alter sent 14 talmidim to help start the yeshiva, known as the י"ד (14) החזקה, including Rav Isser Zalman Meltzer, and the Alter's son, Rav Lazer Yudel.
4. Kletsk tried to "steal" these talmidim but Slutsk didn't stand for it, so after some time, they made their way to Slutsk.
5. The yeshiva started in 1897, with Rav Isser Zalman as the rosh yeshiva.[^14]
### Continuation of Slutsk
1. In 1903, the Ridvaz made aliyah, so the Rav Isser Zalman was appointed as rav of the town.[^14]
2. In 1914, before the ourbreak of WWI, Rav Aharon Kotler married Rav Isser Zalman's daughter.[^14]
3. Because of financial hardship, Rav Isser Zalman had to go fundraise, so Rav Aharon would be the acting rosh yeshiva in a sense during his absence.[^14]
### Creation of Kletsk
1. In 1921, the yeshiva moved to Kletsk with Rav Aharon as the rosh yeshiva.[^14] (The Wikipedia article says that the yeshiva moved, but I think Rav Lopiansky said that they were both open at the same time for a little bit. I'm not sure about this.)
2. The reason for this was because Slutsk was in Russia and the Bolsheviks did not allow religion. Kletsk was in Poland where practicing religion was allowed.[^3][^14]
3. Rav Isser Zalman stayed in Slutsk for some time as he was the rav of the city and didn't want to abandon the people. [^3][^14]
### Continuation of Kletsk
1. At some point Rav Isser Zalman made his way over to Kletsk as well due to the pressures of the Bolsheviks.[^3] (I don't know exactly when. Different Wikipedia articles said different things[^15] and Rav Lopiansky didn't give an exact year. It would seem to be between 1921 and 1923.)
2. In 1925, Rav Isser Zalman made aliyah.[^3]
3. At it's peak, the yeshiva had 260 talmidim.[^14]
4. Rav Shach was a talmid of the yeshiva.[^3]
### Rav Aharon
#### America
1. Rav Aharon frequently came to America to raise money for the yeshiva.[^3]
2. During his time in America, he was extremely concerned by the lack of Torah.[^3]
3. He therefore pushed Rav Shraga Feivel Mendelowitz to start a kollel in America.[^3][^16]
4. He fled to America in 1941 and spent the war trying to get people out of Europe.[^3]
##### Lakewood
1. In 1943, Rav Aharon opened Lakewood.[^3]
2. Before then, YU was the right wing yeshiva in America. Lakewood radically changed that.[^3]
3. Lakewood brought a real vision of Torah and creating people learning to America.[^3]
#### Style of Teaching
1. Rav Aharon was extremely passionate when he was teaching. (For a discussion about it, see [[General Hashkafa#Rav Aharon Kotler's Intensity|here]].) This was in sharp contrast to Rav Isser Zalman who was very calm and even tempered.[^3]
2. His shiurim involved crazy cheshbon and they were extremely difficult to follow. One had to be lighting quick to keep up.[^3]

## Baranovich
### Creation of the Yeshiva
1. The yeshiva was a started in 1906 by Rav Yisroel Yaakov Lubchansky, a son-in-law and talmid of the Alter of Novardok. The yeshiva was called Yeshiva Ohel Torah.[^17][^18] (This was part of Novardok's overall hashkafa of [[#Harbatzas Hatorah|Novardok's overall hashkafa of creating yeshivos]].)[^19]
2. Rav Lubchansky's father was the rav of the city of Baranovich. However, Rav Lubchansky did not want to follow in his father's footsteps and so he decided to make the yeshiva instead.[^17]
3. The yeshiva was not particularly special until Rav Elchonon Wasserman joined the yeshiva as the rosh yeshiva in 1921.[^17][^18]
### Description of the Yeshiva
1. One thing that was unique about the yeshiva was that it was for younger bochurim. Most yeshivos had talmidim that were at least "beis medrash age". Baranovich had talmidim between the ages 13 and 18 (and sometimes even younger).[^17]
2. The yeshiva was very structured. Different masechtos were taught to different talmidim depending on their age. Rav Elchonon was very makpid not to move boys to a different shiur than their age. The highest shiur was given by Rav Elchonon. The oldest boys learned on their own and had a shiur once or twice a week from Rav Elchonon.[^17] ^ac9786
3. Rav Elchonon gave a daily shiur in Mishna Berurah. This eventually standardized the learning of Mishna Berurah in the yeshiva world.[^17]
4. Many gedolim who learned in Europe during this time started in Baranovich, such as Rav Shmuel Birnbaum and Rav Nachum.[^17]
#### Rabbeim in the Yeshiva
1. Rav Lubchansky was the mashgiach in the yeshiva.[^17]
2. He never had any children, and so the talmidim of the yeshiva became his children.[^17]
3. The Tzemach Tzedek was also a rebbi in the yeshiva.[^17]
4. There were several other gedolim involved as well.[^17] {<font color="#ff0000">Find out who these were.</font>}
5. The strength of these gedolim is what allowed the yeshiva to remain strong, even though Rav Elchonon would leave every Elul as well as the whole entire 1938, when he went fundraising in America.[^17]
### Rav Elchonon
#### Background
1. He learned from Rav Shimon Shkop as well as Rav Chaim Brisker.[^20] As such, his learning style had a heavy Brisker influence. His rebbi in hanhagah was the Chofetz Chaim.[^17]
2. According to many, Rav Elchonon was the talmid muvhak of the Chofetz Chaim.[^17]
3. He went to the Chofetz Chaim to learn every Elul. When the Chofetz Chaim was nifter, he went to learn by the Alter of Slabodka.[^17] {<font color="#ff0000">Need to double-check this</font>}
#### Personality
1. Rav Elchonon was an extremely measured person.[^17]
2. He was very makpid on time.[^17]
3. He chose his exact wording when giving over shiur. It is said about Rav Elchonon that sometimes, if a talmid would not understand something, Rav Elchonon would think about what the talmid asked, and then repeat the point the talmid was asking on exactly how he said it the first time (meaning, he said exactly what he meant to say exactly how he meant to say it).[^17]
4. This also fits with how Rav Elchonon set up the yeshiva to be [[#^ac9786|very structured]].[^17]
5. On the day Rav Elchonon was leaving for America in 1938, he gave shiur like usual, and then off he meant. (It is important to keep in mind that he planned on going for a year, and that traveling in those days was far more of an ordeal than it is now.)[^17]
#### Trip to America
1. In 1938, Rav Elchonon traveled to America to raise money to build a building for his yeshiva.[^17]
2. While in America, he became the rebbi for future askonim, such as Mike Tress, Irving Bunim {<font color="#ff0000">Need to double-check this</font>} and others. These people helped out the next generation of gedolim who came to America to spread Torah.[^17]
3. Unfortunately, the money was never used for the yeshiva because the yeshiva was destroyed by the Nazis.[^17]
4. You do see how the yad Hashem plays out in a sense. Rav Elchonon came to America to raise money and it turned out that the money never was used for the yeshiva. However, the talmidim he created during this time ended up being a vital part of the growth of Torah in America.[^17]
### Slonimer Chassidim
1. Slonimer chassidim had their center in Baranovich during this time.[^17]
2. Sometimes, Rav Elchonon would go to the shalosh seudos tish.
3. He was friends with the gedolim of Slonim.[^17]
## Novardok
### Creation of the Yeshiva
1. The yeshiva was started by Rav Yosef Yoizel Horowitz (Hurwitz. The Alter of Novordok) in 1896.[^21][^22]
### The Alter of Novordok (Rav Yosef Yoizel Horowitz)
1. Rav Yosef Yoizel was a bright talmid growing up.[^21]
2. His father-in-law was nifter shortly before the wedding so Rav Yosef took over his father-in-law's textile business.[^21]
3. He started learning from Rav Yisroel Salanter and was totally taken in by the mussar movement.[^22]
4. He spent time learning from Rav Yitzchak Blazer, Simcha Zissel Ziv, and Rav Chaim Brisker.[^22]
5. His personality was very extreme. This became part of the fiber of the yeshiva.[^22]
6. He was nifter in 1919 from typhus he caught while visiting sick talmidim.[^22]
#### In Isolation
1. Rav Yosef decided to go into isolation to work on himself. For two years, he did this.[^22][^23]
5. During his time in isolation, Rav Yosef became a lightning-rod for attacks froms chassidim who were badmouthing the mussar movement.[^22][^23]
6. Many gedolim tried to get him to come out of his seclusion. They told him he was creating a chilul Hashem.[^22][^23]
7. The Alter of Kelm told him he was being too self-centered. This got him to come out of seclusion.[^23]
8. This caused him to go to the opposite extreme. He created a yeshiva and [[#Harbatzas Hatorah|started opening yeshivos in many towns]].[^23]
### Hashkafa
1. We have extremely strong negios which have powerful influences us. A majority, if not all of our decisions are because of our negios, such as what other people think of you.[^22]
2. The only way to make sure that one is not susceptible to these negios is through intensely working on oneself.[^22]
### Description of the Yeshiva
1. A lot of the mussar was focused on being real with oneself and not being fake.[^22]
2. Talmidim would get together in chaburos where they would bash themselves and talk about their weaknesses.[^22]
#### Mussar Exercises
1. Talmidim would do exercises to work on themselves.[^22]
2. They would go into stores and ask for crazy things to train themselves to not care about getting laughed at.[^22]
3. They would go into the woods for days and bring no supplies with them. They had bitachon that they would find what they would need. (Working on emunah and bitachon was a very powerful testament to how real one was.)[^22]
#### Harbatzas Hatorah
1. The yeshiva was very into harbatzas hatorah.[^22]
2. They set up small yeshivos in many towns across Lithuania, Belarus, and Western Russia.[^22]
3. At the height of the yeshiva, there were about 70 of these yeshivos, including [[#Baranovich]].[^22]
4. The cities were decided by throwing a dart at a map. If there was a city in the area where that needed a yeshiva, then the city was chosen.[^22] (I don't know if this was literal.)
5. Talmidim from Novardok were chosen to be the rosh yeshiva and mashgiach. They were given almost nothing to help them start this yeshiva. They had to raise the money to purchase train tickets to get to the yeshiva.[^22]
6. When they got to the town, they would announce in shul that the yeshiva of the town of (fill in the blank) has just opened up.[^22]
7. For lunch, they would send a kid out to go collect some bread from the townspeople for the yeshiva.[^22]
8. They would verbally (and sometimes perhaps even physically) drag kids in to  join the yeshiva.[^22]
9. This had success. There were some gedolim that started off in sniffs (such as the ones in Baranovich, for instance).[^22]
10. The basic system was that there were many of these little yeshivos (which were called "sniffs") and a few main yeshivos (called merkazim). The stronger talmidim from the sniffs would go to a merkaz.[^22]
11. Some of these merkazim were Baranovich, Pinsk, and Bialystok.[^22]
### The Intensity of the Yeshiva
1. Rav Chaim Shmuelevitz, a grandson of the Alter said that utilizing the growth offered by the yeshiva was positive, if used in moderation.[^22]
2. History seems to agree with this as the yeshiva was unable to rebuild after WWII, despite numerous efforts. France is unique in that it actually it did build a Novordok style yeshiva later.[^22]
3. Due to the extreme nature of the yeshiva, the talmidim of the yeshiva were able to withstand enormous pressures caused by WWI.[^22]
### Continuation of the Yeshiva
1. After the death of the Alter, Rabbi Avraham Yoffen, the son-in-law of the Alter, took over the yeshiva.[^22]
2. At this point, the center of the yeshiva moved to Bialystok.[^22]
### The "Alumni"
1. Once a year, the yeshiva would have a big get-together for the talmidim of the yeshiva out in these towns.[^22]
2. Periodically, they would publish and distribute the shmuzen of the talmidim of the yeshiva.[^22]
## Mir
### Creation of the Yeshiva
1. The Mir Yeshiva was started in 1814, 1815, or 1817 by Rav Shmuel Tiktinsky.[^24][^25]
2. This was the second yeshiva of the "modern yeshivos", only after Volozhin.[^26]
### Continuation of the Yeshiva
1. The yeshiva was not very popular at first. It started growing in popularity when Rav Chaim Leb Tiktinsky, the son of Rav Shmuel Tiktinsky, took over.[^26]
2. Rav Yisroel Salanter said that if someone wants to understand a daf gemara properly, they have to go the shiur of Rav Chaim Leb.[^27]
#### The Yeshiva in the 1900s
1. After Rav Chaim Leb, his son, Rav Avraham took over.[^26]
2. He brought in Rav Eliyahu Baruch Kamai to the yeshiva around the turn of the century.[^26]
3. Rav Eliyahu Baruch's daughter married Rav Leizer Yudel Finkel (son of the Alter of Slabodka) in 1903, and in 1906, he joined the yeshiva as well.[^28] He became the rosh yeshiva after Rav Eliyahu Baruch was nifter in 1917.[^26][^29]
4. In 1910, Rav Yeruchem Levovitz was brought on as mashgiach. He remained as the mashgiach until WWI. He came back in 1924 until he was nifter in 1936.[^26][^30]
5. After the death of Rav Yeruchem, Rav Chatzkel Levenstein became mashgiach. (There may have been a person or two between Rav Yeruchem and Rav Chatzkel but this did not last long.) The younger generation fully accepted Rav Chatzkel. That was less so by the older generation.[^26]
##### Description of the Yeshiva
1. The yeshiva was set up so that the older bochurim would influence the younger bochurim (as opposed to having all the growth coming from the hanhala of the yeshiva).[^26]
2. Rav Yeruchem's style of shmuzen was more sophisticated and complex. This sat very well with the talmidim of the yeshiva, who were quite bright.[^26]
3. The yeshiva (while it was in Europe) reached it's "golden age" between the world wars. It had close to 500 of the most chashuv talmidim. the yeshiva was very selective about who it would take in. For some time, nearly all of the Roshei Yeshiva in Europe learned in the Mir.[^26]
##### Motivation from Rav Leizer Yudel
1. Rav Leizer Yudel would go around to the other yeshivos and get (sometimes by paying) the top bochurim from other yeshivos, such as Grodno, Kaminetz, and Kletsk. Mir was sort of like what Lakewood is today: the place you go after you finished learning in a different yeshiva.[^26][^31]
2. After he would get the bochurim, though, he would then push them hard to get them learn as much as they could.[^26]
3. Rav Yeruchem would foster some level of competition between the chaburos to generate growth amongst the talmidim.[^26]
4. One year, Rav Leizer Yudel offered bochurim money if they could learn Bava Kamma, Bava Metzia, Bava Basra, and Kesubos in one year and be tested. Ten bochurim were able to accomplish this.[^26]
##### Strengthening Weaker Countries
1. As said before, the yeshiva was very selective about who it would take in. However, this was not so when it came to talmidim from countries that had weak connections to Torah, like America, South Africa, Germany and Holland.[^26]
2. The Mir set up chavrusah shafs between these talmidim and the top talmidim in the Mir (who were the future gedolim)2. This helped these talmidim grow tremendously.[^26]
3. This created a nucleus of strong talmidim in these countries to help jumpstart Torah growth there.[^26]
4. In addition, when the talmidim of the Mir ended up in these countries (like America after the war), they had a place to go to.[^26]
#### Escape Through Shanghai
{<font color="#ff0000">Need to research this</font>}
#### After WWII
1. Rav Leizer Yudel restated the yeshiva from scratch in Eretz Yisroel. He didn't have any of his donors or his talmidim and he was already in his 60s. This grew into the Mir of today. (This is an inspiration for what can happen when one perseveres.)[^26]
## Radin
### Creation of the Yeshiva
1. The Chofetz Chaim started the yeshiva in 1869.[^32]
2. In 1883, the Chofetz Chaim brought on Rav Hirsh Levinson (his son-in-law) to help him run the yeshiva. The yeshiva started gaining some popularity at that point.[^33] ^41f3e7
### Continuation of the Yeshiva
1. In 1900, the Chofetz Chaim brought in Rav Moshe Landinski.[^34] ^86e2cb
2. He was a tremendous talmid chochom. He had such bekiyos, that sometimes the Chofetz Chaim would ask him for maareh mekomos on things.[^35]
3. Despite this, the yeshiva was not so popular under him.[^35]
4. The Chofetz Chaim asked him if he could bring in another rosh yeshiva in his stead. Even though it was difficult for Rav Landinski, he agreed,[^36] and in 1904, the Chofetz Chaim brought in Rav Naftoli Trop.[^35]
#### The "Golden Years"
1. Under Rav Naftoli, the yeshiva started to really grow, becoming one of the largest yeshivos in Europe.[^35][^37]
2. Rav Yeruchom Levovitz was the mashgiach of the yeshiva from 1907 until 1910.[^38]
3. Rav Naftoli remained the rosh yeshiva until he was nifter in 1928.[^35]
#### Decline
1. The Chofetz Chaim then appointed Rav Boruch Feivelson (son-in-law of Rav Naftoli) and Rav Mendel Zaks (his own son-in-law) to be the roshei yeshiva.[^39]
2. At that point, the yeshiva started to decline as there was no Rav Naftoli and the Chofetz Chaim himself was getting older.[^35]
3. Rav Boruch Feivelson remained rosh yeshiva until he was nifter in 1933.[^40] Rav Zaks remained the rosh yeshiva until the yeshiva disbanded in WWII.[^35]
### Hashkafos
#### Modernizing
1. The Chofetz Chaim was not into the [[General Hashkafa#Change in Learning Style (Rav Chaim Brisker)|new style of learning]] (meaning, the fancy lomdus and the focusing on a few masechtos of the Brisker derech halimud, I think). He didn't want to change from the old style of learning Brachos straight through Niddah.[^35]
2. He was not into the bochurim's [[General Hashkafa#Shpitziness in European Yeshivos|modern and classy style of dress]]. He felt that one should be comfortable with only having a little bit.[^35]
3. However, he understood the needs of the bochurim and so the yeshiva was modernized. For example, Rav Naftoli Trop was brought in to bring in the Brisker style of learning.[^35]
#### Stance on Mussar
1. He felt that yeshivos should have mussar. However, it should be "simpler" (see [[#^5756ac|here]]).
### The Chofetz Chaim
#### Early Life
1. The Chofetz Chaim was born in 1838.[^41]
2. His father until his father died when he was ten years old.[^42]
3. The family moved to Vilna so the Chofetz Chaim could continue learning under Rav Yaakov Barit.[^43]
4. His mother remarried a man from Radin, so they moved there.[^35]
5. At 17, the Chofetz Chaim married this man's daughter (his step-sister. This is mutar because one may marry a step-sibling that one does not grow up with).[^35]
6. From a young age, the Chofetz Chaim was very bright and a tremendous ba'al middos.[^35]
7. Because of this, people of the haskala tried to get the Chofetz Chaim. Obviously, they did not get the Chofetz Chaim. Because of his experience, the Chofetz Chaim was extremely sharp with the haskala.[^35]
#### Later Years
1. The Chofetz Chaim originally supported himself through a grocery. He got the money to start it as an inheritance from a relative.[^35]
2. His wife would mostly run it but the Chofetz Chaim would check the books and do things like that.[^35]
3. Later in life, he supported himself through the sefarim he wrote.[^35]
#### Sefarim
1. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisrael_Meir_Kagan#Works) for a list of sefarim he wrote and a basic idea of what they are about.
#### Style of Mussar
1. The Chofetz Chaim had a more "simplistic" approach to mussar.[^35] (I am not entirely sure what Rab Lopiansky meant by this. I think he might have meant that the Chofetz Chaim didn't focus on deep psychology and philosophy or theoretical concepts (not that the Chofetz Chaim didn't know these things because he obviously did). He had a very strong focus on ahavas Hashem and yiras Hashem. This fits with the fact that the Chofetz Chaim would have conversations with Hashem. Another point that he emphasized was being true to one's word. I don't know how this would fit with the idea of knowing kochos hanefesh as having that knowledge is extremely useful for fighting the yetzer. In all likelihood, I simply didn't really understand this point.) ^5756ac
#### Perception from the World
1. The Chofetz Chaim was unique for a Litvishe gadol in the sense that he had tremendous ruach Hakodesh. He is almost the Litvishe world's version of a rebbe.[^35]
2. The Chofetz Chaim held Rav Chaim Ozer to be the gadol hador, but because of his ruach hakodesh, people wouldn't go against something that the Chofetz Chaim said.[^35]
#### Some Unique Qualities
1. The Chofetz Chaim was unique in what he wrote. Most people have something specific that they find interesting or whatever and they write about that. The Chofetz Chaim saw what Klal Yisroel needed and he then wrote a sefer on that. This was why he started his yeshiva, as well.[^35]
2. The examples given in sefer Shmiras Halashon are very relatable. This is fascinating considering the fact that the Chofetz Chaim was not one to sit around shmoozing.[^35]
#### Role in Yeshiva
1. The Chofetz Chaim would raise money for the yeshiva. People had tremendous respect for the Chofetz Chaim so this made it somewhat easier.[^35]
2. He would have final say about accepting or kicking out certain bochurim.[^35]
3. The Chofetz Chaim started off giving shiur. At some point (certainly when he [[#^86e2cb|brought in Rav Moshe Landinski]] and maybe even when he [[#^41f3e7|brought in Rav Hirsh Levinson]]) he stopped giving regular shiur.[^35][^44]
4. He did give a regular mussar va'ad. Unfortunately, not much of them were recorded.[^35][^45]
## Grodno
### Creation of the Yeshiva
1. The yeshiva was started in 1914 or 1916.[^46] It was called Yeshiva Shaar HaTorah.
2. Grodno was unique in that it was started by bochurim. During WWI, bochurim were displaced and so they started this yeshiva.[^47]
3. Rav Isser Zalman was worried about the talmidim in the yeshiva and so he, as well as the Chofetz Chaim, Rav Chaim Ozer, and Rav Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman encouraged Rav Shimon Shkop to become the yeshiva in 1920.[^47][^48]
4. Rav Isser Zalman originally took responsibility for the finances of the yeshiva. Eventually, this fell onto Rav Shimon.[^47]
### Continuation of the Yeshiva
1. While Rav Shimon was the rosh yeshiva, he did not take a salary due to the tough financial situation of the yeshiva.[^47]
2. To support himself, Rav Shimon became a rav of a suburb of the city of Grodno.[^47]
3. Whenever Rav Shimon would leave (including the year he spent in America), he would appoint two talmidim to take over the rabbanus. (He only chose bochurem who were able to do the job.)[^47]
### End of the Yeshiva
1. Rav Shimon remained rosh yeshiva until just before Grodno was invaded by the Russians in 1939 at the beginning of WWII.[^49]
2. Rav Shimon told his talmidim to leave Grodno for Vilna.[^49]
3. He was nifter two days later.[^49]
4. Most of the talmidim ended up joining other yeshivos, such as the Mir.[^47]
### Rav Shimon Shkop
#### Early Life
1. Rav Shimon was born in 1860.
2. He learned in the Mir, and in Volozhin, under the Netziv and Rav Chaim.[^50]
#### Positions
1. From 1884 until 1902, he was rosh mesivta of Telz Yeshiva.[^47][^51]
2. After that, he became the rav of Moltsh and Bransk.[^47][^52]
#### Trip to America
1. In 1928, Rav Shimon traveled to America to raise money for the yeshiva.[^47][^53]
2. During that year, he became rosh yeshiva of YU.[^47][^54]
3. The yeshiva was so enamored with Rav Shimon that they offered to financially back Grodno if Rav Shimon was willing to stay in YU.[^47]
4. Rav Shimon wanted to take the job, but Rav Isser Zalman and others encouraged him to return to Grodno.[^47]
#### Learning Style
1. His learning style is a spin-off of Rav Chaim.[^47]
2. There are strong polarized feelings about his style of learning. Some people very much love it and think that this is the ikar Torah, and some people feel that it is too pie-in-the-sky and esoteric.[^47]
3. He wrote a sefer called שערי יושר. The sefer is organized by topic. It goes through major inyanim like rov, and chazaka, for example. This makes it a rather unique sefer in this sense as most sefarim are organized by sugyos.[^47]
#### Hashkafos {Need to add these to [[General Hashkafa|hashkafa]]}
1. In the introduction to שערי יושר, Rav Shimon writes that one need to give "מעשר" on one's time to do chesed.[^47]
2. We see from Yaakov and the fact that he was hit on the hip, that whenever someone gets involved in evil, even if they doing it totally lisheim shamayim, the evil will leave its mark.[^47]
### Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah in Queens
1. Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah in Queens was started by Rav Kalman Epstein, a great-grandson-in-law of Rav Shimon, and Rav Sholom Spitz. It is sort of a continuation of Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah in Grodno.[^47][^55][^56]
