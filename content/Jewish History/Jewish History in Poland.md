# General Polish History
## General Timeline
### Early Poland (11th Century - 14th Century)
1. Before the existence of the country of Poland, the land was largely occupied by roving nomadic tribes.[^1] {<font color="#ff0000">Need to confirm this. The source was not particularly clear about this point</font><font color="#ff0000">.</font>}
2. Poland began in the 990s when the king converted to Catholicism. This was unique as most countries were part of an orthodox church (Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, etc.) [^1] {<font color="#ff0000">No idea what the differences between the two are or what the significance is. Needs to be researched</font>.}
3. There were powerful nobles underneath a king. At any time, either one would be more powerful than the other. [^1] {<font color="#ff0000">Was this a feudalism-like system?</font>} This was important for playing politics.
### Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
1. In the late 1300s, the king of Poland married the queen of Lithuania, which brought the countries closer together. [^1]
2. In 1569, the two countries officially unified into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[^1][^2]
3. Poland was the place to be in Europe during the 1500 and 1600s. [^1] See [[Europe 1648|this map]].
#### Decline
1. The Commonwealth started its decline and was slowly nibbled away by other countries (Prussia (located in modern-day Germany), Austria-Hungary, and Russia).[^1]
### Cease to Exist as an Independent Country
1. By 1795, Poland (and Lithuania) ceased to exist and would remain this way for many years. [^1]
2. Napoleon started his rise in 1805. After his downfall in 1815, the countries of the world convened in the Congress of Vienna to redraw lines between countries. {<font color="#ff0000">Need to confirm this.</font>} [^1]
3. At this conference, part of Poland was officially divided between Prussia and Austria-Hungary. The rest was turned into an autonomous state inside of Russia called Congress Poland. [^1]
4. This situation remained this way until 1918 (post-WWI). [^1]
### Post-WWI
1. New borders were drawn up for many countries and new countries were created, including the recreation of Poland and Lithuania. [^1] See [[Europe Pre- and Post- WWI|this map]].
2. However, there were disagreements these countries as well as Russia over which land was owned by who, which turned into the the Polish-Lithuanian War, Polish-Soviet War, and the Lithuanian–Soviet War.[^3][^4][^5]
3. Poland ended up gaining some land from Lithuania and Russia from these wars.[^1][^3][^4]
4. Belarus and Ukraine also declared independence, but they were swallowed up by Poland and Russia.[^6][^7]
5. Due to these wars, tensions were high and the border was closed (to varying degrees) between these countries.[^1]
## Focus on Education in the Late 1800s
1. In the late 1800s, many central and Eastern European countries started trying to become more cultured and civilized. As such, many of these countries (such as Austria-Hungary, under whom was much of the Polish land) started focusing on the education of its citizens.[^8]
2. In 1874, Austria-Hungary passed a law that required all children to attend school.[^8]
# Jewish-Focused Polish History
1. Jews were largely in France and Germany during the times of the rishonim. Because of much antisemitism during the late 1400s, many Jews traveled East toward Poland. [^1]
2. Tremendous gedolim in [[#Early Poland (1500s and 1600s) |the 1500s and early 1600s.]]
3. Poland originally accepted Jews as they were a somewhat backward country and Jews were businessmen (I’m not sure how this fits with Poland being a powerhouse around this time. Perhaps that was only later in the 1500s). As Poland modernized, Jews became less wanted. [^1]
4. Creation of the [[#Vaad Daled Aratzos]] during the 1600s and 1700s.
5. In the early 1600s, Poland controlled much of Ukraine. They forced the people there to be serfs on land that the Polish noblemen in Poland would control. [^1]
6. They would hire Jews to run and manage these places for them. This was a very steady and solid parnasah during this time. [^1]
7. The Ukrainians did not like this. This created a strong drive for nationalism {Need to confirm this} and they united under Khmelnytsky. Because the Jews collected the taxes, they were not well liked amongst the Ukrainians. When the Ukrainians revolted in 1648, they killed tens of thousands of Jews. This became known as גזירת ת"ח ות"ט. [^1][^9][^10]
8. This destruction laid the groundwork for the Jews to gather around any sort of glimmer of hope. Hence, this was shortly followed by Shabsai Tzvi, who actually began making his claims in 1648 as well. Although he did not start in Poland, his movement did take strong root and had terrible consequences. [^1][^11]
9. This was later followed by a local false messiah named Jacob Frank (who claimed to be a gilgul of Shabsai Tzvi) in 1759. This also had devastating consequences. [^1] [^12]
10. This also led to the creation {<font color="#ff0000">or was it started elsewhere but took strong root here?</font>} of chassidus. {<font color="#ff0000">Not exactly sure how this happened. Perhaps people were looking for something to latch onto?</font>}[^1]
11. Polish Chassidus was originally like other forms of chassidus but eventually, largely turned into Ger.[^1]
12. At this point in time, if you were frum, you were a chassid, and if you were not a chassid, you were not frum. This way of life lasted up to WWI.[^1] {<font color="#ff0000">I’m not sure what the state of things were at the time, I think Judaism was struggling a bit but I'm not sure.</font>}
## Warsaw 1800s- 1900s
1. During this time (late 1800s and early 1900s), Warsaw became a major city. [^13]
2. 1. Warsaw became a big city in the late 1800s and early 1900s. [^13]
3. They had advanced medical centers and spas there so many people came for treatment and many died there. This is why the Warsaw cemetery has many gedolim buried there, such as Rav Chaim Brisker and the Nitziv, even though these gedolim spent their lives in other places. [^13]
## WWI and Post-WWI
1. WWI decimated Jewish communities as the front between Russia and the Germans with the Austrian-Hungarians kept moving back and forth across Poland. [^14][^15]
2. There was a tremendous amount of antisemitism after WWI.
3. This was because:
	1. Intense feelings of nationalism which were especially fueled by being under Russian rule for over 100 years. The Poles viewed the Jews as outsiders. [^1]
	2. During WWI the Jews were suspected of collaborating with the Germans as the Jews spoke Yiddish and there were many Jews in Germany. In addition, Germany was a more civilized place for Jews [^15] (Rav Lopiansky actually only mentioned this in regards to the fact that the Russian Tsar moved Jews out of Poland and deeper into Russia because he thought they might join the Germans. I’m taking the assumption that this led to increased antisemitism.) (this is despite the fact that there were also many Jews in Poland and around 250,000 that served in the Russian army). [^16]
## Effects of the Polish-Lithuanian War
1. Because of the Polish-Lithuanian War, many of the yeshivos, such as Mir, Kaminetz, and Baranovitch, ended up on the Polish side. Much of the Jewish population that were in Lithuania, ended up being in Poland, as well, such as the Jews of Vilna. Slabodka and Kovno stayed in Lithuania.[^15][^17]
2. In addition, the border became more difficult to cross, so people had to sneak their way over, or enter in through a 3rd country.[^15]
3. WWII came and the Jews were decimated in Poland (85% - 95%). They have never had a large presence since. [^1]
# Early Poland (1500s and 1600s)
1. Includes a tremendous amount of gedolim, including [[#Rav Yaakov Pollak]], [[#Rav Shalom Shachna]], the [[#Maharshal]], the Rema (Rav Moshe Isserles 1530 – 1572 [^18]), the Maharshah (Rav Shmuel Eidels 1555 – 1631 [^19]), the [[#The Smah|Smah]], the Maharam (Rav Meir Lublin 1558 – 1616 [^20]), the Bach (Rav Yoel Sirkis 1561 – 1640. Father-in-law of the Taz [^21]), the Taz (David ha-Levi Segal 1586 – 1667 [^22]), the Shach (Rav Shabtai Hakohen 1621–1662 [^23]) the Beis Shmuel (Rav Shmuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus 1625 or 1650 - 1701 [^24]), and others.
## Rav Yaakov Pollak
1. Rav Yaakov Pollak lived from 1460 or 70 - 1541. [^25]
2. Was the rebbi of Rabbi Shalom Shachna of Lublin, Meïr of Padua (Maharam Padua) and the Maharal of Prague. [^25]
3. He, along with his talmid Rav Shachna, is considered the father of the learning style of Rettinsburg Pilpul which is a style of pilpul which is not accepted. [^26]
4. The style of pilpul takes the assumption that the gemarah knew every step at every step. So every time you go through a step in the gemarah, you have to relearn the whole gemarah. Also, the style of pilpul might seek to address a question in a way that might work in cheshbon but is totally not mistaver and therefore not pshat in the gemarah. [^26]
## Rav Shalom Shachna
1. Rav Shalom Shachna lived from 1490 or 1510 - 1558. [^27]
2. He was the father-in-law and rebbi of the Rema. [^26][^27]
3. Established a big yeshiva in Lublin in 1515. [^27]
 ^f7cb43
4. As mentioned, he is considered the father of Rettinsburg Pilpul, along with his Rebbi, Rav Yaakov Pollak. [^26]
## Maharshal
1. Rav Shlomo Luria (1510 – November 7, 1573). [^28]
2. Took over the Yeshiva of Lublin after the death of Rav Shalom Shachna and later opened his own yeshiva. [^28]
3. Wrote Chochmas Shlomo (his pirush at the back of the gemarah) and Yam Shel Shlomo, amongst other things. [^26][^28]
4. Was opposed to the Shulchan Aruch and Rema-style approach to giving over halacha. The Rosh and the Rif, for example, write on the gemarah. A posek has to learn them and then he can come to his own psakim. The Shluchan Aruch is not like that. The Shulchan Aruch writes clear cut psakim. The Maharshal felt that this was against the mesorah. The gemarah was the last piece of universally accepted codified halacha and that was it. There was to be no more after that. 
   For this reason, he was against the Rambam as well.
   This is part of why he wrote his Yam Shel Shlomo. [^26]
5. It seems that Klal Yisroel has accepted the Shulchan Aruch and Rema-style of psak. [^26]
6. The Maharshal was a bit sharp sometimes. He was not one to pull punches. [^26]
## The Smah
1. Rav Yehoshua Hakohen Falk (1555 – 29 March 1614). Also known as the Mahari Katz. [^29]
2. Also authored the Prishah and the Drishah. [^26]
3. He was a talmid of the Rema and the Maharshal. [^29]
# Polish Chassidus
1. Includes [[#Peshischa]], [[#Kotzk]], [[#Piaseczno (Piacezna) Rebbe|Piaseczno]] (commonly spelled Piacezna, even though Piaseczno is the way the name of the town is spelled) and [[#Ger]] (which may be the most popular and well known form a chassidus). [^30]
## The Chozeh of Lublin
1. Originally started in the 1700s with the Chozeh of Lublin, Rav Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz. [^30]
2. The Chozeh was called this because he was able to “see” things (meaning, he had ruach hakodesh). The story goes that he had this because he was very makpid on shmiras einayim. [^30]
3. Chassidus was centered around the simple Jew. [^30]
4. The Torah from them contains a lot of derush. [^30]
## Peshischa
1. The Yid Hakadosh (Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz) broke off of this to create his own brand of Chassidus which became known as Peshischa. [^30]
2. This type of Chassidus was more of an elitist type of chassidus. It focused more on learning, and on being real with oneself. The divrei Torah reflect this. [^30][^31]
3. After the Yid Hakadosh died, Rav Simcha Bunim took over the chassidus. [^30][^31]
## Kotzk
1. After Rav Simcha Bunim died, Peshischa branched into several different ways. One of those became Kotzk and was led by the Kotzker (Rav Menachem Mendel Morgenstern). [^30][^32] 
2. The Kotzker was an iluy in learning. (I don’t think that this is to the exclusion of the other rebbes mentioned) [^30]
3. Kotzk was like a more extreme version of Peshisch. The mussar from the rebbe was extremely biting with an extreme focus on not being fake. [^30]
4. For about the last 20 years of his life, the Kotzker only dealt with his closest talmidim. [^30]
5. The chassidus seemed to have been too extreme for it to really last. [^30]
## Ger
1. After the Kotzker was nifter in the mid 1800s, the Chidushei Harim took over the chassidus. [^30]
2. The Chassidus morphed into what we know as Ger. {<font color="#ff0000">need to look into how that happened</font>} [^30]
3. The Chidushei Harim was a tremendous gaon and was very charismatic. He was very sought after by a few chassiduses to become their rebbe. {<font color="#ff0000">Need to check that.</font>} [^30]
4. He was originally a talmid of the Kushnitzer but after the father died and the son took over {don’t know which rebbe of Kushnitz this is referring to} he had some sort of fight and ended up joining Peshischa. [^30]
5. All of his kids {or sons, I don’t know which} died during his lifetime. He felt this was because of his fight with the Kushnitzer. However, he still felt that he made the correct decision to leave Kushnitz. [^30]
6. He turned down the intensity that was brought in by the Kotzker by a lot. [^30] {<font color="#ff0000">I’m not sure how things went exactly. Was he the rebbe after the death of the Kotzker and Kotzk sort of merged into Peshischa or was he the rebbe of Peshischa at at the same time as the Kotzker was the rebbe of Kotzk?</font>}
7. The divrei torah are much more peshat oriented. They seem to be trying to understand what the passuk is saying (I don’t think this is to the exclusion of Kutzk and Peshischa divrei Torah.) [^30]
8. After the death of the Chidushei Harim, the chassidus was then led by Rabbi Chanoch Henach Hakohen Levin from 1866 until 1870. [^33]
9. The Sfas Emes was the grandson of the Chidushei Harim and he took over the chassidus afterwards at 22 years old. [^30][^33]
10. He was orphaned of both of his parents by the time he was 8 years old and was brought up by the Chidushei Harim until the death of the Chidushei Harim.[^30][^33]
11. The sefer Sfas Emes is similar to the style of the Chidushei Harim in that it seeks peshat and tries to make sense of the passuk (with references to higher concepts as well). [^30]
12. The Sfas emes died from heartache in 1905 as the Russians drafted many of his Chassidim to fight in the Russo-Japanese War. [^30]
13. His sefer lives on. It is incredibly popular in Ger. (Almost sounds like a Chiddushei Halev in Chofetz Chaim.) [^30]
## Piaseczno (Piacezna) Rebbe
1. Rav Kalonymus Kalman Shapira was born in 1889[^34][^35]
2. He had Yichus. His grandfather, father, and father-in-law were all rebbes.[^34]
3. He was more worldly than the average rebbe. He knew languages, played instruments and read a lot.[^34]
4. He wrote numerous sefarim, such as the Eish Kodesh, Sefer Chovas Hatalmidim, a sefer for married people (which he did not finish), and an introduction for people learning Kabbalah. [^34][^35]
5. Chovos Hatalmidim is a guidebook for chassidishe bochurim. It is similar to Alei Shor for Litvishe Bochurim (I don’t know in what sense this is. R’ Lopiansky did not explain what he meant). [^34]
6. In the days of the Piacezna, the chinuch was very strict. Ger was the popular Chassidus at that point and Ger maintained a lot of the intensity and brutal honesty of Kutzk. Because of this, many children were going off the derech. [^34]
7. The Piacezna looked at this situation as a problem with the rabbeim and the system in general, not with the kids (meaning, the style of chinuch had to change, not the kids). [^34]
8. His system was much more positive. He focused on instilling into the kids the importance of being Jewish and the importance of their role as the future Klal Yisroel. This is at least part of what Sefer Chovos Hatalmidim is about. The sefer is still extremely relevant in our times. [^34]
9. He founded a yeshiva called Daas Moshe in 1923. [^34]
10. Near the beginning of World War II, his son and daughter-in-law were killed by a German bombing raid. [^34][^35]
11. During the war, he was sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. [^34][^35]
12. He was deported to the Trawniki concentration camp where he was killed in 1943. [[^35]
13. His sefer, Eish Kodesh, was found posthumously in a milk jug. [^34][^35]
## Ishbitza (Radziner)
### Formation
1. Breakoff of Kotzk. [^34]
2. Kotzk was getting very harsh with its chassidim. For example, chassidim were expected to be by the rebbe and leave their families for months (while their families didn’t have ways to support themselves). [^34]
3. It came to a head on Simchas Torah. The Kotzker wasn’t coming out to dance hakafos with his chassidim. He felt that his chassidim weren’t ready to dance with the Torah. They only acted like they loved the Torah but they didn’t actually feel that way. This went on for several hours. [^34]
4. One of the close chassidim named Rav Mordechai Yosef Leiner thought that this was not right. He took a group of chassidim to a different shul where they danced hakafos. [^34]
5. This led to Rav Leiner forming his own Chassidus. This was the beginning of Ishbitz. [^34]
6. Rav Leiner was joined by Rav Leibel Eiger (son of Rav Shlomo Eiger and grandson of Rav Akiva Eiger) and Rav Tzadok Hakohen Rabinowitz. [^34]
7. Rav Leibel Eiger originally learned by his grandfather, Rav Akiva Eiger. After his grandfather’s passing he started learning by the Chidushei Harrim (before he became the rebbe of Ger). This exposed him to chassidus.[^36]
8. Rav Leibel Eiger joining the chassidus created a schism between him and his father. Rav Akiva Eiger was more tolerant. [^34]
### Elements
1. Back to the focus on the simple Jew, but did keep some elements of the “be real with yourself” from Kotzk. [^34]
2. The Torah is deep but pshat oriented (seemed similar to the Torah of Kutzk and Ger from the way it was described). [^34]
3. One unique thing that is focused on in the Torah of Ishbitz is trying to figure out the good in an aveirah. [^34]
4. This leads to a lot of controversy over the Torah that is said as it almost sounds like it is defending doing aveiros, like doing aveiros lishmah that Shabsai Tzvi said to do. (Bizman Hazeh, their Torah is accepted, you just have to know that the authors may not mean exactly what it sounds like they are saying. In the past, it seems that their sefarim were attacked on the basis of reading them literally.) [^34]
5. Two examples of this are a discussion that Pinchas didn’t understand the deep intentions of Zimri, and that it was good that Korach fought against Moshe because that gave the people more emunah when he lost. [^34]
### Leadership
1. As mentioned, the chassidus was started by Rav Mordechai Yosef Leiner, who became known as the Ishbitzer. His Torah was recorded in the sefer Mei Hashiloach by his grandson, Rav Gershon Henach of Radzin (who later became the rebbe of the Radziner chassidim) and so the Ishbitzer is also known by the name of the sefer.[^37]
12. After the death of Rav Mordechai Yosef Leiner in 1854, the chassidus split in two. One part settled in Radzin (Radziner chassidim) and was led by his son, Rav Yaakov Leiner. The other part settled in Lublin and was led by Rav Leibel Eiger.[^36]
### Branches

#### Radzin
1. Rav Yaakov authored the sefer Beis Yaakov and so also went by the name of his sefer. He led the chassidus until his death in 1878.[^38]
2. After his death, his son, Rav Gershon Henach Leiner took over the chassidus. He wrote the sefer orchos chaim and was subsequently known by the name of the sefer. He led the chassidus until his death in 1890.[^38]
#### Lublin
1. Rav Eiger led the chassidus with Rav Tzadok Rabinowitz as his right-hand man. After the death of Rav Eiger in 1888, Rav Tzadok Rabinowitz took over and Rav Avraham Eiger, Rav Leibel Eiger’s son, became his right-hand man. (It doesn’t explicitly say that Rav Avraham was the right-hand man, but some sources say that Rav Tzadok took over and others say that they both took over, so it seemed to me that Rav Tzadok was the main rebbe while Rav Avraham was his assistant, especially considering the fact that Rav Tzadok worked with Rav Leibel and so was already a generation up.) [^36][^39]
2. Rav Tzadok led the chassidus until his death in 1900. Because Rav Tzadok did not have any children, the chassidus went back to Rav Eiger’s lineage until WWII. [^36]
# Other Noteworthy Occurrences
## Vaad Daled Aratzos
1. During the 1600 and 1700s there was a pan-communal group called the vaad daled aratzos (sometimes called the vaad hey aratzos or vaad gimmel aratzos, depending on how you divided the lands). [^1]
2. This is the precursor for organizations like Agudah. [^1]
3. The groups were largely Polish but sometimes Lithuanian communities would be part as well. [^1]
4. They met twice a year, usually at the great fair of Berlin. [^1]
5. They would pasken shailos, put people in cheirem and take them out, and they would deal with “franchises”. Jews would manage lands in Ukraine (discussed shortly) and sometimes one Jew would try to undercut another Jew by telling the Polish nobleman who owns the land that he could do a better job running the place than the current Jew running the place was doing. [^1]
## Rav Meir Shapiro
1. Rav Meir Shapiro was great in many ways. He was an iluy, people-smart, a visionary, charismatic, and situationally savvy in the sense that he knew how to play politics. [^40]
2. He was born in 1887 and was nifter in 1933.[^40][^41]
3. His two major projects were daf yomi and Yeshiva Chachmei Lublin (יח"ל). [^40]
4. He wanted יח"ל to be very shpitzy, similar to what the Alter of Slabodka did in Slabodka. He wanted a nice building, he wanted the bochurim to dress elegantly, and he wanted to pay for the bochurim’s room and board. See [Shpitziness in European Yeshivos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G9MyZ7hkdbQ55tiod1kWFLN2z-TGUhaIFnR8WyFCVq4/edit#bookmark=id.arjl6mm7obgo) for why this was important. [^40]
5. Before this, the store owners would have bochurim sleep in shops to keep away thieves. Rav Meir Shapiro drily noted the tremendous zechus the Polish thieves had. [^40]
6. He fundraised for seven years to create the yeshiva. [^40]
7. Poland didn’t really have a general derech halimud. This was because nearly every chassidus had their own yeshiva and there was very little cross-pollination (a chassid in one chassidus was not likely to go learn at the yeshiva of a different chassidus). [^40]
8. As such, Rav Meir Shapiro traveled to Lithuania to examine the different darchei limud there and then create one. (By this time Rav Chaim Brisker’s mehalech was widespread amongst the yeshivos). [^40]
9. The derech halimud he came up with was four years of kodshim (Rav Lopiansky didn’t know why this was) followed by three years of standard semichah. [^40]
10. The yeshiva building was massive. It was six floors and had 20,000 sefarim. [^40]
11. The bochurim walked around with fancy silver walking sticks. [^40]
12. The yeshiva did not align itself with any particular chassidus. This was necessary to attract bochurim from all different chassiduses. (This ties back into Rav Meir Shapiro’s savviness and understanding of people.) [^40]
13. There were some general chassidish elements to the yeshiva: The yeshiva had a mikvah and had a Friday night tish. [^40]
14. After the death of Rav Meir Shapiro, the yeshiva hired a new rosh yeshiva. [^40]
15. He had some interesting shitos and so the yeshiva moved on from him after a few years. [^40]
16. The yeshiva hired a massive talmid chochom after this. [^40]
17. Both of these roshei yeshivos were chassidish. Chassidim were not going to learn under a Litvish rosh yeshiva. [^40]
18. Under this rosh yeshiva, the yeshiva started to regain some momentum it lost since the death of Rav Meir Shapiro. [^40]
19. Unfortunately, this did not last long as the Nazis destroyed the yeshiva in 1940. [^40]
20. During its time, the yeshiva produced some great talmidei chachamim, such as Rav Shmuel Vosner. [^40]
## Sarah Schenirer and the Beis Yaakov Movement
### Background: Chinuch in the late 1800s - WWI
1. See [[#Focus on Education in the Late 1800s|here]].
2. Until this time, boys would go to cheder and girls would stay home with their mothers. Home keeping (without washing machines and running water and all that) was a full time job.[^8]
3. Girls wouldn't know very much. They would know a little about davening. Some could read and write, but many could not.[^8]
4. Boys would still be sent to cheder against the czar's law. People would play shtick and paid fines, but they viewed it as worth it to keep the boys learning Torah.[^8]
5. Girls' education was viewed as less important and so they were sent off to public school, with almost no Jewish education.[^8]
6. This did not end well for the girls. By the end of the century, girls were going off the derech left and right. The boys were struggling as well but nowhere near as much as the girls.[^8]
7. In addition, even for the girls who tried to remain frum there was a tremendous social pressure from their pears.[^8]
8. For whatever reason, people clung to the "old way" of not having formal chinuch for girls ("mesorah", "this is the way it's always been", etc.)[^8] ^724bc9
9. WWI destroyed the Jewish community and way of life. At this point, people weren't sticking to the "old system" anymore. That had clearly been utterly annihilated by the war.[^8]
### Sarah Schenirer
#### Growing Up
1. Sarah Schenirer was born in the 1883 in Krakow.[^42]
2. Her parents were Belzer chassidim from great families and gave her a strong Torah background.[^43]
3. Like all the other girls of the time, she went to public school.[^8]
#### Personality
1. She was adventurous and liked being outdoors and going on hikes,[^8] yet she also was intelligent and loved to learn Torah.[^44]
#### During WWI
1. During WWI she moved with her family to Vienna.[^8][^45]
2. While there, she was strongly influenced by Rabbi Flesch.[^8][^46]
   Generally דרשות were long on pilpul (complicated questions and answers) and short on inspiration. Rabbi Flesch's דרשות were the opposite; short and to the point. This both inspired Sarah Schenirer, as well gave her a style to teach Torah.[^8] ^8829d1
#### Personal Life
1. Sarah Schenirer got married. She wanted to get divorced immediately, but people convinced her to stay on. Sher got divorced after three years.[^8]
2. She later on got remarried.[^8]
3. Little is known about either marriage. (And she kept going by her maiden name, which may indicate something.)[^8]
4. She never had any children. (If she did have children, would she be able to do what she did?)[^8]
### Pre-Beis Yaakov
1. Sarah Schenirer tried to make frum social groups for girls, to help them learn about Yiddishkeit as well as to help them deal with the social pressure.[^8]
2. However, this movement did not succeed.[^8]
3. Sarah Schenirer felt that she needed to be mechanech girls when they were younger.[^8]
### The Beis Yaakov Movement
#### Support from Gedolim
1. Because she was from Belz, Sarah Schenirer asked her brother to get a haskama from the Belzer rebbe.[^8]
2. At first, the Belzer rebbe gave his haskama to the movement, but then later rescinded it. It is not know why.[^8][^47]
3. The Chofetz Chaim (perhaps the gadol hador of the non-chassidish world) and the Gerer rebbe gave her their haskamos. This gave the movement a lot of support.[^8] ^8085a2
#### Starting off
1. In 1918, Sarah Schenirer opened her first school. It was run out of her home in Krakow.[^8]
#### Seminary
1. Sarah Schenirer created a seminary to train teachers as the Beis Yaakov movement was growing so fast, she did not have enough teachers.[^8]
#### The Success of the Movement
1. In 1940, everything was destroyed by the Nazis in WWII.[^8]
2. Before then, there were hundreds of Beis Yaakovs with about 40,000 girls.[^8] [^47]
#### Style of Teaching
1. Lessons focused on the inspiration rather than on the pilpul (as [[#^8829d1|mentioned]]).[^8]
2. The Torah of Rav Shimshon Raphael Hirsch was commonly taught as it was high on inspiration and low on pilpul, and because many Germans opened school (see [[#^6bfabc|later]]) and they were more familiar with the Torah of Rav Hirsch.
3. Chinuch for girls was all about things like "don't do this and don't do that" and "stay quite and don't be seen or heard". This rarely works on the youth, but this time of history was particularly bad for this. This was an age of movements (communism, socialism, Zionism, etc.). It was an age of people thinking big and trying to change the world. This "classic" style of girls' education was trampled by this momentum.[^8]
4. Sarah Schenirer was full of energy and life. As such, the girls would go on [^48]hikes, make and sing songs, and put on plays.[^8]
#### Reaction
1. The non-frum did not like the Beis Yaakov movement. They made fun and mocked it.[^8][^47] They wanted to get rid of the old and "modernize". Obviously, the Bies Yaakov movement did not fit with their outlook.[^47]
2. At first, the frum did not accept the movement either (because people were attached to "the old way" as [[#^724bc9|mentioned]]).[^8]
#### Help From Others
1. While Sarah Schenirer was the spark behind the movement, many German Jews helped with the logistics, creating a curriculum, and opening schools. (The German Jews had tremendous organizational skills.)[^47] ^6bfabc
2. Because of the Gerer Rebbe's support, as [[#^8085a2|mentioned]], the Gerer's got involved in opening schools, as well. A Gerer actually took over the movement after Sarah Schenirer was nifteres in 1938.[^47]
3. At some point relatively early, Agudah got involved.
### Beis Yaakovs in Other Countries
1. Lithuania, Germany, and Israel had their own girls' schools. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I need to do research on these and on how they affected the modern day Beis Yaakovs.</span>}
### Impact
1. Many say that if not for Sarah Schenirer, Klal Yisroel would have ceased to exist (bderech hatevah). the yeshivos were producing, but what good would it have been if there weren't any frum girls for them to marry.[^47]
