- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Red font is used for notes to myself (meaning, things like "add source", or to write out something I am confused about and need to do additional research into).</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(112, 48, 160)">Purple font is sometimes used when I am presenting an example of something </span>
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">Yellow and</span> <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">green font </span>are used to present counterarguments against the original point and counters to those counters. It will be apparent from the context which one is doing what. Think of it like the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">yellow</span> and <span style="color:rgb(146, 208, 80)">green</span> are two different sides of an argument.
