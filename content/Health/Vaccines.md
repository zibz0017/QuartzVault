# General Vaccines

## Double-blind Random Control Trials for Vaccines
1. Randomized double blind placebo control (RDBPC) studies are considered the “gold standard” of epidemiologic studies.[^1]
2. Lots of vaccines do not go through double-blind random control trials (trials against a saline placebo).[^2]
3. However, this is only true for vaccines that already have previously working versions {<font color="#ff0000">or any cure at all? I’m not sure.</font>} and they are trying to improve the vaccine in some way. The reason for this is that it is unethical to run a random control trial (meaning, some people get the cure and others only receive a placebo) when there are working versions of the vaccine available. {<font color="#ff0000">or some other medically proven working cure of any kind?</font>}. Instead what they do is test the vaccine against previous versions of the vaccine that they know are effective. New vaccines are tested in placebo controlled trials.[^2]
	1. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> While this sounds like a reasonable policy is this the way it is actually carried out?[^3]
	2. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> Perhaps the previous versions of the vaccine lose their effectiveness over time and so testing against them is meaningless, or at least not as meaningful as it may seem. And you obviously can’t test those previous versions to prove their effectiveness unless you test them against still further previous versions which may have also lost their effectiveness.[^3]
	3. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> I am also not sure how this way also doesn’t lead to ethical concerns. Some patients are only going to be receiving the experimental treatment and not receiving proven treatments. I guess even experimental treatments need to be proven to some degree before being run in a human trial so there is good reason to believe that this treatment will be at least similarly effective to the established version.[^3]
	4. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> How do these rules apply to other forms of treatment of a disease? That seems like it could be important to know. Like if vaccines have significantly different forms of testing than other treatments, that seems like a potential red flag.
## Mass Amounts of Vaccinations
1. Vaccines are only tested on an individual level (meaning, the effects of one particular vaccine on a person). The effects of many vaccines in quick succession being used on people are not tested. {<font color="#ff0000">Need source</font>}
	1. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> While this is true, the question is does that make it worth it to not get vaccines
## Aluminum in Vaccines
1. There is aluminum in vaccines and it is far higher than the recommended daily maximum. {I heard this from Yisrael Peikes. He said he checked it up and it is true. I should ask him for the source.}
	1. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> While this is true, the question is how bad is it to pass this mark relatively infrequently.
# Coronavirus Vaccine
## Reasons to be Skeptical (of the Vaccine and the Government/CDC/WHO)
### Rights of the Vaccinated vs the Unvaccinated with Antibodies
1. Why did the U.S. government (or the CDC. These terms may be used interchangeably) not allow people with antibodies the same rights as people who had the vaccine? {<font color="#ff0000">need source</font>} It would seem that getting the actual disease is just as effective for protecting oneself as taking the vaccine. {<font color="#ff0000">need source</font>}
	1. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> The government did not want people to attempt to contract Corona on purpose to give themselves the same rights as those with the vaccine.
2. Nurses who tested positive who had the vaccine were allowed to work while nurses who tested negative who didn’t have the vaccine were not. {<font color="#ff0000">need source</font>}    
### Post-Corona Excess Deaths
1. There have been about 20% excess deaths in Europe since Corona. This is consistent amongst all age groups[^4][^5]
	1. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> How abnormal is it for excess to swing above and below the expected deaths by this much? Perhaps it is not particularly uncommon.
	2. <font color="#9bbb59">Possible counter:</font> The excess deaths are not due to the vaccine. They are due to the missed treatments and checkups and the like that occurred during Corona.
	3. <font color="#f79646">Counter:</font> While that makes sense for old people, it does not make sense for young people.[^4]
