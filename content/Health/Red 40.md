# Potential Health Risks

1. ADHD or hyperactivity and aggression.[^1][^2] For most kids, this is not a concern. However, it is for some.[^2] As such, if oneâ€™s children are acting hyper after having something with red 40, then it might be worth it to try cutting out red 40 and seeing if that cuts down the hyperactivity.[^1]
2. Depression.[^1]
3. Migraines.[^1]
4. Allergic reactions.[^1][^2]However, these are rare.[^2]
5. Cancer, however, this may be only if you consume well more than is usually consumed. If you have an increased risk of cancer, it would seem wise to steer clear.[^1]
