# Yeshivos

## Shpitziness in European Yeshivos

Some yeshivos in Europe (such as Yeshiva Chachmei Lublin, Slabodka, Radin, and Volozhin) had their bochurim dressed nicely (walking with silver walking sticks), had beautiful buildings as well as pay the townspeople to make food for the bochurim instead of relying on tzedakah from them. This was for a few reasons:

1. In terms of dressing nicely and having beautiful buildings, during this time, universities were on the rise. Their students looked sophisticated (dressed nicely, clean shaven, etc.) as well as acted sophisticated (analyzed and thought deeply about things). Yeshiva bochurim needed to keep up with them for a few reasons:

	1. To avoid a Chillul Hashem (people would look down on yeshiva bochurim).
	
	2. To avoid dissuading potential talmidim from joining the yeshiva. This might have been even more true of the smartest bochurim who were potentially targeted by the maskilim (such as the Chofetz Chaim when he was young).
    
	3. To avoid destroying the bochurim’s self-image.


2. In terms of paying families for food, the families looked down on the yeshiva bochurim for taking the food away from their kids as well as being a leech on society. They also cooked the worst meal on that night. By paying the families (some of them receiving substantial portions of the money they made through this), the families took a much more positive look at the yeshiva and the bochurim. This was important for the three reasons mentioned before.[^1]
   
   There are elements of this which some felt were not ideal. The Chofetz Chaim, for example, did not like these changes. He felt that that people should be mistapek bimuat. However, he understood the changing times and realized that this is what the bochurim needed.[^2]

## Change in Learning Style (Rav Chaim Brisker)

{<font color="#ff0000">Need to discuss what the changes were</font>}

As discussed in the [[#Shpitziness in European Yeshivos]] section, the new style of learning attracted the smart bochurim, instead the more memorizing style of learning that was before.

## Yeshiva as Focus of Community
See [[#Yeshiva|here]].

## Small Town Vs. Big Town
Yeshivos in Europe were largely created in smaller towns. This was for a few reasons:
1. There are less distractions in a small town compared to the big city.[^3]
2. The Haskala had a weaker influence in smaller towns. The movement was focused on larger towns, with their universities and theaters.[^3]
3. The people of the town really took ownership of the yeshiva when it was a small town. There was a more personal connection.[^3]
4. Big towns have politics.

## Hashpah of Yeshivos in Europe
As more and more people started going to yeshiva, more and more people started having the yeshiva hashkafos and sensitivities. That started making inroads into the rest of the people.[^4] (To me, this doesn't sound very different then the idea of making yeshivos in smaller, out-of-town communities today.)

# Different Communal Structures

## Kehilla

1. Historically, this system largely existed in Oberland (Northern Hungary), Germany, and Sefardim.[^3]
2. Despite the problems with the system (as will be discussed shortly), it is still somewhat effective and for the Litvish, it is important to be part of a kehilla after one leaves yeshiva.[^4]
### Pros
1. Created a strong barrier against the outside world. If you did not shtel to the standards of the kehilla, you would be rejected by the kehilla. Due to antisemitism, you usually couldn't just join the non-Jewish world either, so this was very effective.[^4]
2. There is a strong respect for the Torah authority.[^4]
### Cons
1. This is only effective as long as there is no alternative to the kehilla. But if you can join a different kehilla, then this becomes largely ineffective. In addition, the non-Jewish world is far less hostile toward the Jewish world so there is less pressure from that angle, as well.[^4]
2. This system relies on a tremendous respect for the rav. As the community grows in their own knowledge, the gap between the rav and the members of the kehilla gets smaller and so, naturally, there is less respect.[^4]
3. There is little focus on personal growth. The mentality is "we do this because this is the way it has always been done". There is little drive to perfect oneself or anything like that.[^4]
## Chassidus

1. Historically, this system largely existed in Poland, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and parts of Hungary.[^3]
### Pros
1. Many of the same pros as the kehilla.[^4]
2. In addition, a Chassidus transcends space. You can be part of a chassidus even if you don't live near the main chassidus.[^4]
3. Chassidus emphasizes a strong emotional connection to Yiddishkeit.[^4]
4. A chassidus is a tremendous powerhouse. If a rebbe wants something to get done, he has a whole army to mobilize to get it done.[^4] (For an example, see the Gerer Rebbe's support of the Bais Yaakov movement {<font color="#ff0000">need to add a link here</font>})
### Cons
1. Similar to kehillos, there is little drive for personal growth. There is a tremendous respect for the rebbe, but not particularly for talmidei chachamim.[^4] (This probably varies based on the chassidus. Some have more of a focus on Torah.)
2. Chassidus relies on a rebbe having a personal kesher with his chassidim. This works as long as the chassidus is small, but as the chassidus grows, practically, this becomes impossible. Lubavitch is an exception in that the rebbe was able to know what his chassidim were doing.[^4]
3. Emotionally charged events (like a tish, for example) get old after a while.[^4]

## Yeshiva

1. Historically , this system largely existed in Lithuania, Belarus, and parts of western Russia.[^3]
### Pros
1. The system of growth focuses on Torah. As such, one is not bound by time or anything like that to grow (as opposed to a tish, for example).[^4]
2. By learning, one develops his thinking.[^4]
3. This system may have the greatest focus on personal growth.[^5]
4. Naturally, one performs many mitzvos (talmid Torah kineged kulam).[^5]
### Cons
1. People feel like a failure after they leave yeshiva.[^4]
2. People feel like yeshiva did not adequately prepare them for life.[^4]
3. People have certain hanhagos that they keep while in yeshiva which are unfortunately not realistic to keep doing once someone leaves the yeshiva. This is a difficult adjustment for people.[^4]
4. There is a very small focus on an emotional attachment to Yiddishkeit and many people do not feel connected.[^5]

# Rav Aharon Kotler's Intensity
1. Rav Aharon was very passionate when he gave shiur.
2. If people interrupted him in the middle to ask questions, (potentially, even if they were legitimate questions.[^6] This point seems to be disagreed about. See [[#The Honor of Torah]] with the footnotes there.) he would get upset and the guy asking the question and use seemingly intense language.[^6] ^b75c18
3. He would apologize afterwards.[^6]
4. Even so, this seems difficult to understand from a gadol like Rav Aharon.[^6]
## Explanations
### The Intensity of his Focus
The way to view this is like an artist painting a masterpiece. They have such an intense level of focus that a distraction is really jarring to them.[^6][^7][^8]
### The Honor of Torah
The Torah is too precious to allow people to say things without giving it the necessary level of thought. If one properly appreciated the respect the Torah deserved, they would view it as a disgrace to allow people to just say whatever pshat popped into their heads.[^9][^10][^11]
### Pushing His Talmidim
Perhaps it could be that Rav Aharon was trying to push his talmidim. Lihavdil, when a professional coach pushes a player hard, we might think that that is quite reasonable. When one is engaging in a certain field that requires a demanding level of perfection, we are okay with that level of perfection being demanded, even aggressively. Perhaps the same was going on here.[^12][^13]
# Punishment from Hashem
## Why Might Someone be Punished
1. There is an idea that Hashem doesn't always punish people because they deserve punishment. Hashem may indirectly punish people. An example might be that someone does an aveirah and so they lose their money. Their innocent child now does not have that money.[^14][^15] (This would seem to argue on the idea of the Chovos Halivavos that nobody can help you or hurt you if it is not ordained by Hashem.)[^16]
2. Hashem might punish someone to get them to not do something. For example, if someone's parents do certain aveiros and the child also does those same aveiros, the child might need a more forceful knock to get rid of the negative middah now that it had been so inculcated into the child. In a sense, this can actually be viewed as a chesed from Hashem (because, hopefully, the person was not nichshal).[^14]
3. If some people do aveiros, Hashem may remove his direct hashgacha from Klal Yisroel and allow the "natural course" of events to occur. This can result in random people suffering.[^14][^17]
# Physical Proximity Affects Zechusim of Tazadikim
1. Klal Yisroel lost the battle of עי partially because Yehoshua needed to go with the soldiers for his zechusim to have a positive affect.[^18]
   It seems that the affect of Yehoshua's zechusim was tied to his physical location.[^19]   
# The Mussar Movement 
1. The mussar movement started getting involved in yeshivos because of Rav Yisroel. Rav Yisroel originally wanted the movement to target the masses but he was able to pivot when he saw it would be more effective to have the movement in yeshivos.[^3]
2. Volozhin was not part of the mussar movement. However, after Volozhin, most yeshivos became part of it.[^4]
## The anti-Mussar Movement
1. To clarify, nobody is against yiras shamayim and good middos. That is not what the disagreement centers around.
3. It created an alternative focus to learning (and learning is obviously the main thing).[^3]
4. It gave a lot of the power to the mashgiach (taking away a lot of the power from the main person with the daas Torah in the yeshiva, namely, the Rosh Yeshiva of the yeshiva.)[^3]
# NCSY
## History
1. Started in the 1950s by Rabbi Stolper.[^20]
2. Originally targeted kids in out-of-town communities with little to no exposure to Torah (most, if not nearly all, of the kids were in public school).[^20]
## Current
### Negative Perception of NCSY
1. There seems to be some negative sentiment toward NCSY now. This is because the organization can sometimes lower the aspirations of those going there. NCSY has a strong emphasis on marrying Jewish, which of course is extremely important, but it seems that many times they do not push beyond that. Many of the kids who go there would seem to benefit from having higher aspirations. This is more of a problem now then when the program started as many kids who go to NCSY are exposed to Judaism in other ways and so there perhaps is more to work with, as opposed to the public school kids that largely made up the NCSY students in the past.[^21]
2. NCSY has become a place for girls and boys to hang out. Once again, I feel like this might be a bigger problem now that many kids who go to NCSY are in non-coed Jewish schools. As such, kids are hanging out with the opposite gender perhaps considerably more than they would otherwise. In addition, this may create mixed massaging: teachers and rabbeim at school are telling kids not to hang out with the opposite gender and NCSY seems to imply that it is not so bad.[^21]
3. Kids of various levels end up there. Meaning, some kids might be struggling with high school, while others have long been kicked out and are doing much worse things. And now these struggling kids are getting exposed and developing relationships with these hardcore kids.[^21]
# Agadita
{<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">There are lots of Rishonim/Achronim brought down in this section, but I don't know where these come come from. It would definitely be nice to find the actual sources of these opinions.</span>}
## Reading the Torah Literally
{<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I am not sure if this really belongs in this section.</span>}
1. Rav Sadia Gaon writes that almost everything in the Torah should be taken literally with a few obvious exceptions such as:
	1. Things about Hashem.[^22]
	2. If there is a contradiction between two pisukim (obviously they can't both be literal.)[^22]
	3. Obvious mashalim (like when it says that Hashem will cut out the arlas halev, that is not literal).[^22]
	4. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">There was a fourth point as well, but I don't know what it is. It seems to be in the same vein of things that obviously shouldn't be taken literally.</span>}
2. The Rashba writes very harshly about those who try to learn the Torah alegorically.[^22]
## Why Agadita is Hidden
1. The Ramchal {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I think</span>} writes that agadita is hidden in mashalim because:
	1. Agadita deals with the deep secrets of the Torah, and the same way one may not want to share their deepest secrets, even if it isn't embarrassing or anything, it's just that it is extremely personal and so they are not appropriate to publicize.[^22]
	2. People can make mistakes and these topics are extremely core to Yiddishkeit and so we can't have people make mistakes with them.[^22]
2. The Gra writes on the Agadita Dirabba Bar Bar Chana that the deepest secrets of the Torah are found here. The corruption of the world has forced Hashem to hide the most precious parts of the Torah in what seems like fairy tales.[^22]
## Where Agadita is Written
1. Agadita is generally found in Shas, Midrashim with a mesorah (Midrash Rabbah, Tanchuma, and Pirkei Dirabbi Eliezer), and the Zohar.[^22]
2. In addition, there are a few blatt in Bava Basra of extremely strange agadita (known as Agadita Dirabba Bar Bar Chana).[^22]
## How to Understand Agadita
1. According to the Rashbam some agadita is supposed to be understood only allegorically, some only al pi pshat, and some both.[^22]
# Olam Habba Based on Subjective or Objective Measure
1. At least to some degree, how much olam habba one earns is based on the object mitzvos one does, not just based on how much one fulfills their potential.[^23] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I would like to come back to this and explain what the חובות הלבבות does say and then how I interpreted it.</span>}
