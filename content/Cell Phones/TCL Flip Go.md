# Cons
1. No customizable T9 dictionary, meaning, you can't add your own words to the dictionary.[^1]
2. Can't access messages while on a call.[^1]
3. Alarm time is tied system volume, meaning, if the phone is on silent, or a specific volume, the alarm will go off on that volume. You can't set the alarm to go off on a specific volume if the phone is on a different volume, or only on vibrate.[^1]
