{<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sometimes, I took the assumption that the halachos which were talking about bentching apply to bracha achrona or at least to me'ein shalosh. I need to go back over the article to see what is explicitly said and then deliniate that I assume the same halacha applies to bracha achrona/me'ein shalosh.</span>}
# How Long One Can Wait Before Making a Bracha Achrona
1. One loses the ability to bentch or make a me'ein shalosh {<font color="#ff0000">not sure about borei nifashos</font>} when the food one ate begins to digest. When you start feeling hungry again, that usually means that you digested the food.[^1] (If one doesn't eat their fill and they are hungry immediately, that doesn't mean that they digested the food.)
2. The clock begins after then end of the meal, not the beginning. As such, if someone has a long meal, the clock begins at the end of the meal.[^2]
3. However, if you ate and then you were meysiach daas and then ate more, we do not say that the eatings combine or something. The clock for the first eating began after the end of the first eating.[^2]
## Minimum Amount of Time One Has
1. If you aren't sure if you digested the food yet (like, for example, someone ate less then their fill), one can be confident for 72 minutes that the food was not digested.[^3] (The implication is that even beyond 72 minutes, the food has not been digested. It's just that one can't rely on it, though, if they are unable to tell.)
2. Even so, it is best to eat a kizayis of bread before bentching, just to make sure that the bentching is not a bracha livatala. If someone was mesiach daas, they make a new bracha (as we will [[#How Long One Can Wait Before Making a Bracha Achrona|say shortly]]), eat, and then bentch.[^3]
# How Long One Can Wait Before Needing to Make a new Bracha
1. Even if someone waits too long so they can't bentch, if they were not meysiach daas, they do not make a new bracha.[^4]
# Minimum Amount of Food Eaten to Require Bentching
1. If one eats less than a kizayis, they do not bentch.[^5]
2. If one eats a kizayis but is not full, they bentch midirabanan. (There is no objective measure to "fullness". It changes for every person.)[^5]
# Bentching/Making a Bracha Achrona in One's Original Location
## What Kind of Food
### Bentching and Al Hamichya
1. One needs to make betch/make an al hamichya in one's original place.[^6]
#### Leaving One's Location Before Making a Bracha Achrona
1. If one forgot to bentch/make an al hamichya before leaving one's location, one may bentch/make an al hamichya in the new location, bishaas hadchak.[^7]
2. If one purposely left his location, knowing that he did not bentch/make an al hamichya, he must go back to the original location.[^7] However, if one bentches/makes an al hamichya in the new location, he is yotzei.[^8]
##### How Far Away From One's Original Location Can One Make a Bracha Achrona
1. One can bentch/make a bracha achrona anywhere in the room that one ate.[^9]
2. If there is a מניעה in the room that one ate {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I don't know what is included in this</span>} one can bentch/make a bracha achrona in a different room in the same house as long as one can see the original place he ate.[^9] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I don't know if it has to be the exact place, or within four amos.</span>}
3. If someone is outside in a place not surrounded by walls, every four amos is considered a "new place" from which one is not supposed to leave. One can leave because of a small מניעה.[^10] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Again, I don't know what is included in this but it seems to be smaller than before. Also, I don't know if it literally has to be surrounded by walls. Perhaps a park or some area that we might view as "one area", can be considered to be "one area" in terms of this halacha.</span>}
### Me'ein Shalosh on 7 Minim
1. Lechatchila, one should make a me'ein shalosh before leaving one's location.[^11]
2. If one already made a bracha achrona in a different location, they are certainly yotzai[^12][^13]
3. If one already left his place, it is a machlokes if it is better to go back to one's original location. According to the Mishna Berura (which is the way we in yeshiva hold), one should go back. According to the Aruch Hashulchan, there is a sfek sfaika (namely, that even for bread it is a machlokes if there is any chiyuv to go back,[^14] and it is a macholkes if we compare the 7 minim to bread, in which we actually pasken that it is not[^12][^13]) and so there no point.[^15]
4. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">What's the halahca for wine?</span>}
### If One Ate in the New Location
1. If one had more bread/mezonos in the new location (even less than a kezayis[^16]), you can bentch/make a bracha achrona there, lechatchila.[^17]
2. This is even if one purposely left his original location, knowing that he did not bentch/make a brach achrona yet.[^18]
3. If one needs to bentch, making a mezonos in the new location does not help.[^16]
4. If one already waited so long that he lost can't make a bentch/make a bracha achrona anymore (as [[#How Long One Can Wait Before Making a Bracha Achrona|discussed]]), then obviously this trick doesn't work and you would have to make a new bracha rishona.[^19]
