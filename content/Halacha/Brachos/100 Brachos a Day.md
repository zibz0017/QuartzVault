# Basic Halacha
1. A person is chayiv[^1] to make 100 brachos a day.[^2]
# Natural Amount of Brachos One Makes in a Day
## Weekdays
1. On weekdays, one makes over 100 brachos.[^3]
2. The cheshbon is as follows: Hamapil (1), Al Netilas Yadayim (1), Asher Yatzar (1), Birchas HaTorah (3),[^4] birchas hashachar with hamaavir Sheina and Elokai neshama (16), Tallis/Tzitzis (1), Tefillin (2), Baruch Sheamar (1), Yishtabach (1), Birchas Krias Shema by Shacharis and by Maariv (8), Shemona Esrei three times (3 * 19 = 57), two meals in which one washes and makes an al netilas yadayim (2 * 1 = 2), makes hamotzi (2 * 1 = 2), bentches (4 * 2 = 8), on a cup of wine (2 * 1 = 2), and makes an Al Hagefen (2 * 1 = 2).[^3] ^971701
3. This adds up to 108.
4. Bizman Hazeh, many people do not eat two bread meals a day (and certainly without bentching on a cup of wine), and some only make one bracha on tefillin, so if we remove the brachos for the meals and one bracha on tefilin, we are down to 91 brachos.[^5] ^5f3326
5. However, even if we have three non-washing meals in a day, and we average three brachos per meal (2 different brachos rishonos and a borei nefashos), we would be back to 100. This would not include additional brachos for eating snack or asher yotzar for going to the bathroom.[^5]
## Shabbos
1. On shabbos, we have four shemona esreis of seven brachos a piece (7 * 4 = 28) instead of the usual three shemona esreis with 19 brachos each, puting us down 29 brachos (57 - 28 = 29). We also miss out on Yiru eineinu (1) and brachos on tefilin (2).[^6]
2. However, we also have a third seudah on shabbos (8, as calculated [[#^971701|before]]), birchas meien sheva (the bracha we say on Friday night beginning with Magen Avos), kiddush by night (2) and by day (1).
3. This brings us back up to 87 brachos.[^3][^6] ^362d64
4. However, we may have less than this as many people do not bentch on a cup of wine by any of the meals, removing the bracha on the wine (3 * 1 = 3) and the bracha achrona (3 * 1 = 3). This would bring us down to 81.[^5] ^ae15e7
5. They should make sure to eat different foods.[^3][^6][^7] ע"י הדחק one can be yotzei by being mechavein to the birchos hatorah by the aliyos and haftorah.[^3][^6]
6. One needs to be careful not to make a bracha she'eino tzricha to get to the 100 brachos.[^3][^6]
7. If one is using the birchos hatorah, he should make sure not to answer baruch hu uvaruch shemo during the brachos, as one is not supposed to talk when being yotzei with a bracha through shomeiah keonah. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">need source</span>}
## Yom Tov
1. Yom Tov is not explicitly discussed but it would seem that if one does not have a third meal, then the cheshbon would come out that the person would be missing 8 brachos compared to the [[#^362d64|87 on Shabbos]], bringing the total down to 79.[^5]
2. In addition, as [[#^ae15e7|discussed]], 87 on shabbos assumes that one bentches on a cup of wine. If one does not do, that, they are missing an additional 6 brachos. So on yom tov, one would be missing an additional 4 (as there are only 2 meals), bringing the total down to 75.[^5]
3. One can be mechaein to the brachos on the 5 aliyos by shachris (10), as well as the haftorah (5), bringing us up to 90.[^5]
4. A person can then also be mechavein to the brachos on the aliyos by mincha (6), and the haftorah (4), which would complete the 100.[^5]
5. Also, this does not include going to the bathroom or if a person ate snacks between meals.[^5]
## Fast Days
1. On fast days that begin in the morning, a person just misses the meal during the day. As such they are only down 8 brachos off the 108 of a regular day and so one still has 100 brachos.[^6]
2. As [[#^5f3326|mentioned]], we don't usually bentch on a cup of wine. As such, we may not have 100 brachos (as we have 92 brachos, not including the night meal, which adds 8 brachos if one washes and bentches on a cup of wine).[^5]
3. It would seem that one should wash during the night meal, and so even if one doesn't bentch on a cup of wine, as long as one makes two additional asher yotzars, one will still make 100 brachos.[^5]
## Yom Kippur
1. On Yom Kippur, one only has 97 brachos[^8] so one should supplement with birchas hareiach (in addition to being mechavein to birchas haTorah). אפשר ע"י הדחק one can be yotzei by being mechavein to chazaras hashatz.[^3]
2. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I'm having diffulty getting what the cheshbon is. I checked all of the nosei keilim on</span> [Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.46.3?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en) <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">to this Siman and Sif and I didn't find anyone that goes through the cheshbon. I thought that perhaps it goes as follows: One is missing 3 meals (8 * 3 = 24), plus birchas meien sheva (1), as well as kiddush Friday night (2) and Shabbos day (1), for a total of 28 brachos missed. Counting down from the usual 87 brachos Shabbos has, as </span>[[#^362d64|mentioned]]<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">, this brings the total down to 59. On Yom Kippur, we make a shehechiyanu (1), plus we have neilah (7). In addition, we count the brachos on the aliyos that one is mechavein for. That would be 29 brachos (6 aliyos by shachris plus maftir, with 2 brachos each, as well as 3 aliyos by mincha, 2 brachos each, plus the 5 brachos on the haftora by shachris and 4 by mincha). This would only bring us to 96 brachos. As such, we are 1 bracha short. Perhaps the Mishna Berura is counting the the bracha by birchas kohanim (assuming one is mechavein).</span>}
## Tisha Bav
1. Tisha Bav is not explicitly discussed in the mishna berurah, but based on what we said, it should come out that one only makes 92 brachos (based on the fact that there are 108 brachos per day with two meals of 8 brachos each which are now missed on Tisha Bav.) and so one should try to mechavein to the brachos on the aliyos and haftorah.[^5]
