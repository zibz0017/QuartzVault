1. In the days of the gemarah, everyone would say birchas hashachar as they were getting up and getting themselves ready.[^1]
2. There was no problem of the fact that they touched covered parts of their body while they were sleeping and so they would not be allowed to say the brachos before washing their hands because they were makpid to keep their hands clean, even when they slept[^2][^3][^4]
3. We don’t do this anymore for two reasons:
	1. We do not keep our hands clean when we sleep.[^3]
	2. We want to make the brachos in shul for the sake of the am haaratzim who do not know how to make brachos to be yotzei in shul.[^3]
