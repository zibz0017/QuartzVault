# The Issurim of Chametz
{<font color="#ff0000">This section is extremely important and it needs work</font>}
## Bal Yeirah Uval Yimatzei
1. On a dioraysa level, owning chametz on Pesach alone does not violate an issur. The problem is finding this chametz.[^1]
2. On a dioraysa level, one does not violate an issur if they did the bedika, even if they did not do the bittul. However, you do violate an issur if you find a nice piece of chametz and delay in going to burn it.[^2]
# When to be Bodek
## The Ideal Time
1. One should check on the night of the 14th. Chazal were mesaken this because people are home, and the light of a candle shines more clearly at night. This is important for checking in cracks. Once Chazal were mesaken the night of the 14th, that becomes an additional svarah to check on the 14th night.[^3][^4]
2. One should begin the bedika immediately after tzeis.[^5] One may wait some amount of time but nothing significant.[^6]
## Bedika Before the 14th
1. One can do bedikas chametz at night before the night of the 14th if they are careful not to bring chametz in after they check. There is a chumrah to recheck on the night of the 14th.[^3]
2. One may not check during the day before the 14th night. If one does, they are יוצא בדיעבד and do not need to check again. However, they should recheck one room on the 14th night. Checking by windows, skylights or an אכסדרה (room with only 3 sides[^7] or a room with a lot of windows[^8]) is fine, לכתחילה.[^9] (It seems that one does not make a bracha on this but this is not clear. The Mishna Berura says that if one checks by day in places that are well lit (will be discussed soon) or at night, then one does not make a bracha. But what if one checks in places that are not well lit during the daytime.)
3. Two reasons why we are against doing a bedika by day:
	1. Candles are less effective by day (and sweeping is never particularly effective as it does not reach into cracks.)[^10]
	2. Once the first reason is true, chazal were mesaken it this way and once they are mesaken it this way, we want to stick to it.
4. If one does check before the 14th, they should leave one room unchecked so that on the 14th, they will be able to do a bedika and make a bracha[^11] (Does hiding a few pieces of bread before, as we are noheig, work to allow you to make a bracha on the bedika?)
## Bedika on the 14th Day
1. One should not wait for the 14th day to do the bedika.[^12]
2. If one did wait, then they do not need to use a candle when checking by windows, skylights, or an אכסדרה. For everything else, one should use a candle, just like by night.[^13]
3. They should do the bedika as soon as possible in the morning. They should not eat before doing the bedika.[^12] If one initially forgot and then remembers, they should do the bedika right when they remember.[^14]
4. One is mevatel the chametz when they finish the bedika (unless it is beyond the 6th hour) {<font color="#ff0000">Need to add link to the halacha of bittul after the 6th hour</font>}
# Why We Need Both Bedika and Bittul
1. Midioraysa, either a bittul or bedika is enough. Midirabanan we require both.[^15]
## Reasons for not Relying on Bittul
1. You may not really want to be mevatel the chametz in your heart and so the bittul will fail.[^15]
2. You may see some delicious looking chametz and come to eat it.[^15]
## Reasons for not Relying on Bedika
1. We are concerned that one may find chametz on Pesach, despite doing a bedika and then delay in going to get rid of it, which is an issur.[^15] {<font color="#ff0000">I don't understand the mechanics of the issur. Why does delaying make one violate the issur?</font>}
# What Should be Used
## Flashlight vs Candle
1. According to Rav Elyashiv,[^16] Rav Aharon Kotler, and Rav Moshe Feinstein[^17] one can do the bedika with a candle, lechatchila, if the beam is narrow enough to fit into cracks.
   Rav Moshe holds that it is in fact better to use a flashlight than it is to use a candle.[^17]
2. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach[^18] holds that it is preferable to use a candle because that is the way that chazal were mesaken bedika.
3. According to Rav Nissin Korelitz[^19] and the אור לציון,[^20] one should not use a flashlight.
   According to Rav Korelitz, one can use the flashlight to assist, but in conjunction with the candle.[^19]
   According to the אור לציון, if one only has a flashlight, they should use it, but they should not make a bracha.[^20]
## Leaving the Ceiling Light on
1. If it helps to leave the ceiling light on, according to the Shevet Levi,[^21] Rav Moshe Feinstein,[^22] Rav Elyashiv,[^16] Rav Nissin Korelitz,[^19] the Chazon Ish,[^16] Rav Yaakov Kanievsky,[^23] and Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach,[^24]
# Before the Bedika
## What One may and may not do Before Bedika
### מְלָאכָה 
1. A person may not do any "מְלָאכָה" {<font color="#ff0000">I don't know what is included in this</font>} beginning from a half hour before tzeis on the 14th.[^25]
### Eating
1. One may not eat more than a kibeitza of mezonos/hamotzi food once it is within a half hour before tzeis. There is no limit on non-mezonos and non-hamotzi food.[^26]
### Learning
1. It is a mechlokes if one can begin learning at home within a half hour before tzeis.[^27]
2. If one learns in shul, then everyone agrees that this is okay, because the person will have to head home at some point.[^27] (I think that the Mishna Berura means that in those days, people didn't stay out so late. As such, the person will head home before it is too dark so they won't miss the zman. Assuming that this is the correct understanding, then what is the halacha בזמן הזה?) If one is learning deeply then even learning in shul doesn't help.[^27]
3. If someone appoints a shomer than that it is okay.[^27] However, the shomer himself can't be learning.[^28]
4. Even if someone has a set time to learn, he is not allowed to learn within a half hour before tzeis (unless he employs one of the previous mentioned tachbulos).[^29]
### Davening
1. One should daven before doing the bedika as it is difficult to gather a minyan together when it is so late and we are not concerned that Maariv will extend beyond the time to do the bedika.[^30] (From the first reason, what is the halacha if someone lives in a place with set late minyanim?)
2. If one is davening ביחידות, he should appoint someone else to begin the bedika while he is daving so the bedika begins on time.[^30] (I think that we don't want the person to daven after because teh bedika may last until chatzos, which is that latest one should say krias shema. בזמן הזה that we do most of the bedika before the night of the bedika and so the bedika does not take until anywhere near chatzos, would it be okay to wait until after to daven maariv? Also, I don't know why the person can't daven before after shkiah but before tzeis.)
   If he can't appoint someone else (because, there is nobody else to appoint, let's say), he should daven first and then do the bedika.[^30]   
### If one Started at a Time that it was מותר
1. If one started doing something at a time that it was מותר, (meaning, before half an hour before tzeis) everyone agrees that the person may continue doing whatever it was until tzeis.[^31]
2. Once tzeis comes, it is a machlokes מחבר (one may continue) against the רמ"א (one must stop).[^31]
### If Bedika was not done at Night
1. If one did not do the bedika at night, these halachos apply right away in the morning.[^32]
## Preparations for Bedika
1. One should sweep their house before doing the bedika.[^33]
2. The minhag is to do this on the 13th day, so that way one is ready to go once the night comes.[^33]
3. There is also a minhag to sweep out cracks using a feather.[^33]
# What Requires Bedika
1. If you are unsure if you brought chametz into a room during the year, you need to do a bedika on that room. If you mistamah did not, then you do not.[^34] (Hard to know what the line is. How unsure do you need to be to say that you need to do a bedika. For example, do you need to clean out a closet? It is unlikely that you brought chametz there. Perhaps chametz was kicked in and in Sif Katan 29 the Mishnah Berurah talks about chametz rolling into a hole, however this svarah is not  mentioned here.)
2. If you have children (perhaps even if you don’t have kids but you had kids over) then you have to check wherever they might have brought chametz, including the bathroom.[^35]
3. Ledges unless they are higher than you can reach or within 3 tefachim of the ground (unless you have kids).[^36]
## Roofs, Porches, and Balconies
1. You do not need to check on something with a sloped roof.[^37]
2. You are required to check on something with a flat roof.[^38] As such, it would seem that one needs to check on a porch.[^39]
## Inaccessible Places
1. If the chametz is in an inaccessible, but may become accessible (for example, it is on a ceiling beam, and it may fall off), one needs to get rid of the chametz.[^40]
2. If it will remain in the inaccessible location, one only needs to do bittul and does not need to get rid of the chametz.[^40]
3. If one was not mevatel the chametz until the zman issur, then at that point, bittul does not work and one would have to actually get rid of the chametz.[^41]
## Courtyards
1. The halachos by [[#Animal Cages|animal cages]] apply to courtyards.[^42]
2. In all cases, you have to check the cracks in the walls on the side of a courtyard. [^43][^44]
## Pets
1. If you own a pet, you might not have to do a full bedika. You might only need to sweep out large crumbs from underneath furniture and do a bedika in the kitchen and dining room.[^45]
### Animal Cages
1. If you made sure not to bring Chametz into an animal coop within 30 days of Pesach, then they do not need to be checked.[^46]
2. If there was chametz there within 30 days but before the zman bedika then you should ask a rav.[^46]
3. If there was chametz after the zman bedika, then you actually need to check. You cannot rely on the animal eating the chametz.[^47]
4. You might need to check in cracks in the side of the coop, as is the halacha by [[#Courtyards|courtyards]].
## Bedika on Sefarim
1. The Chazon Ish says that one must do a bedikah in sefarim.[^48] ^d974e7
   He would use a flashlight, or do it by a window during the day.[^49]
2. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach disagrees because he says that you only need to do a bedika on crumbs bigger than a kezayis. [^50] (Others disagree about crumbs smaller than a kezayis. See [[#Have to do a Bedika|here]].)  ^9dbfff
## Crumbs
1. Crumbs are automatically considered to be mevatel.[^2] (Practically, one still has to destroy the chamtez, though, to avoid accidentally eating it.)
### Smaller than a Kezayis
#### Do Not Have to do a Bedika
1. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach [[#^9dbfff|here]] says that one does not need to do a bedika.
#### Have to do a Bedika
1. The Chazon Ish [[#^d974e7|here]] would seem to argue as well as the Machane Yisroel[^51] and the Chayei Adam.[^52]
## Holes in the Wall
1. One has to check holes in the wall for chametz as far as one's arm can reach.[^53]
2. If there is chametz beyond one's reach, one does not have to get it. They can rely on the bitul. This is even if there is vaday chametz.[^54] Also, see [[#Inaccessible Places|here]].
3. (I don't know if this applies today. It seems that it used to be that people stored chametz in holes in their walls. I don't know if that applies now.)[^39]
## Shuls and Batei Medrashim
1. Shuls and betei medrashi require a bedika.[^55]
2. The shamash should do this on the night of the 14th and make a bracha. However, he can not be mevatel the chametz as it is not his.[^55]
## Purses and Pockets
1. If one puts chametz into their pockets or purse from time to time, they need to do a bedika, even if one is sure that there is not chametz in them.[^56] (I assume that the pockets of clean clothing do not need to be checked. Only the pockets of clothing that one has worn and not yet cleaned.)
2. One should check them during the bedika, and shake them out during the biur because even after the bedika, one may have absentmindedly slipped chametz back into their pocket or purse and not remember it[^57] (I assume that this refers to the pockets on the clothes one wore after the bedika, or a purse only if one used it after the bedika, not every pocket on ones clothes.)
# After the Bedika
## What to do with the Chametz
1. After the bedika, one should put the chametz in a secure location where kids and rodents can't get to it (this refers to chametz one found during the bedika as well as chametz one plans to eat the next day). Practically, this means putting your chametz in some kind of box or container, not just leaving it on a table or counter.[^58]
## Bittul
1. One should be mevatel the chametz, immediately.[^59]
2. At night, one is only mevatel the chametz that they did not find. One is not mevatel the chametz they would eat the next day or that one plans on burning as you are supposed to burn your own chametz when doing the biur.[^60]
## Someone Bringing Chametz into a Room that was Already Bodek
### A Child
1. If a child brings chametz into a room that was already checked and one finds crumbs on the floor, he can assume that this is all that there is in the room and the child ate the rest. He does not need to recheck the room.[^61]
2. If you don't find crumbs, but the child reached the age of chinuch and says that he ate the whole thing, he can be trusted and so you do not need to recheck the room.[^62] (this may also be similar to what was said [[#Relying on Women and Ketanim for Bedika|here]].)
### A Goy
1. If a goy brings chametz into some a room that was already checked, we can assume that the goy did not hide the chametz there and so the room does not need another bedika.[^63]
# Leaving One's Home Before Pesach
## Returning After Pesach
### Within 30 Days of Pesach
1. If nobody will be in one's home to do a bedika, one should do a bedika on the night before they leave. One should follow the standard halachos for doing a bedika.[^64]
2. The reason for this is because Chazal were mesaken that 30 days before as the time that the chiyuv begins. This is because this is when one is supposed to begin earning the halachos of the Yom Tov from 30 days before.[^65][^66]
3. One exception to following the halachos is that one does not make a bracha. The bracha is על ביעור חמץ. We view the bedika as part of the biur process when one does the biur shortly after, however, when one does not (like in this situation), one does not make the bracha.[^67]
4. If one doesn't do the bedika at night, they do it in the morning.[^68]
### Before 30 Days of Pesach
1. One does not need to do a bedika.[^69]
2. When Pesach comes around, one would be mevatel the chametz to avoid violating בל יטמין.[^70][^71]
3. One does not make a bracha on the bittul.[^72] (It would seem that one never makes a bracha whenever they are only doing a bittul and not a bedika[^39])
4. It is a machlokes if one has to get rid of chametz that one knows about if they leave before 30 days.[^73] We come out meikel[^74] (as we do by [[#^53cb8c|someone piling things on top of chametz more than 30 days before yom tov]]).[^75]
5. If one did a bedika before leaving, there is no need to be mevatel the chametz.[^76]
## Returning on Pesach
1. One must do a bedika before one leaves, no matter how much before Pesach one leaves. This is even if one is mevatel the chametz.[^77] [^78]
## Returning Before Pesach
1. This all depends on how far one travels and how much before Pesach one plans on returning (the farther on travels and the closer to Pesach one returns, the higher the possibility that one returns later than anticipated, leaving no time to do a bedika).[^79]
2. בשעת הדחק, one can be meikel and not do a bedika.[^80]
3. One should ask their LOR for how this halacha applies בזמן הזה (now that travel, even from distant places, is a lot more predictable than it was).[^39]
# Pile on top of Chametz

## Man Made Pile
1. If one would like to pile things in a room that may have chametz in it (to use the room for storage, for example), one must do this over 30 days before Pesach.[^81]
2. It seems that the pile needs to be over three tefachim high to count. If it is less than 3 tefachim then one must uncover the pile and do a bedika.[^82]
3. If you would like to do it within 30 days, you must do a bedika first. If you didn't do a bedika and just filled the room up, one is required to empty the room and do a bedika.[^83]
4. If the room will be emptied before Pesach, the room must have a bedika before being filled, even if this is over 30 days before Pesach.[^84]
5. If one knows that there is chametz in the room, then it is a machlokes if one has to do a bedika before storing things there before 30 days before Pesach.[^85] We come out meikel.[^74]
## Naturally Made Pile
1. If the pile is three tefachim or less under which might be chametz, one must uncover it to do a bedika, unless they are concerned for snakes and scorpions.[^86]
2. If one knows that there is chametz under the pile, the pile must be uncovered and a bedika must be done, even if one is concerned for snakes and scorpions (you have to make sure to do it in a safe way)[^87]
# Being Mevatel Someone Else's Chametz
1. One should not use a shliach to be mevatel their chametz.[^88]
2. One cannot be mevatel someone else's chametz for them without their express permission. Even if one was appointed by the owner to do the bedika, this does not allow one to do the bitul.[^89]
3. A wife can be mevatel the chametz of her husband. She should say כל חמירא דאיכא" *ברשות בעלי דידע ביה*". One should not rely on this lechatchilah (as it is the husband's chametz and it is not so simple that a person's wife can be mevatel it).[^90]
# Getting Rid of Chametz
1. You may throw your chametz into rishus harabim and be mevatel it.[^91][^116][^115]
2. Hiding chametz (like burying it in your rishus) does not help. If the chametz gets buried on its own (a wall fell down onto the chametz), it is a machlokes if this is a problem on a dioraysa level.[^1]
3. One cannot put chametz into an inaccebile location and then be mevatel it.[^92]
# If Bedika was not Done Before Yom Tov
## On Yom Tov
1. If one did not do a bedika before yom tov, if the chametz was mevatel, then one should wait until chol hamoed to do the bedika.[^93]
2. If there was no bittul, one should do the bedika on yom tov itself.[^93]
3. One would make a bracha on this bedika, whether they were mevatel the chametz before Pesach or not.[^94]
4. One shouldn't touch the chametz. Rather one should flip a כלי upside-down over the chametz.[^93] {<font color="#ff0000">this should link to some halacha in siman 446</font>}
## After Yom Tov
1. If one didn't even do the bedika on Pesach, they should do a bedika after Pesach to get rid of the chametz because one is not allowed to get הֲנָאָה from the chametz שעבר עליו פסח.[^95]
2. One would not make a bracha on this bedika.[^94]
# Finding Chametz on Pesach
## Making a Bracha
1. One would not make any bracha if one finds and gets rid of chametz on Pesach if they did a bedika before Pesach.[^94]
# Finding Chametz After Doing the Bedika
1. If one finds chametz after doing the bedika, he does not need to be concerned that there is more chametz that he missed.[^96]
# Renting a Living Location
## Renting From a Goy
Background: A person has a chiyuv to do a bedika, not just to make sure that they are not ovver on Bal Yeirah or to keep themselves from accidentally eating chametz.[^97]
1. If someone is renting from a goy and leaving within 30 days of Pesach, they don't need to do a bedika because the chametz is mafkired and so we view it likeמשליח אותו ברחוב and they'll do a bedika on the house they move into.[^97]
2. If they move into a house with a Jewish owner who already did a bedika, they still don't need to do a bedika on the house they left because we view the Jewish owner like the shliach of the tenant so it is as if the tenant did a bedika.[^98]
3. Similarly, if another Jew is going to move into the house of this goy after the original Jew left, the Jew who left does not need to do a bedika because the Jew moving in after him has to do a bedika and we view him like a shliach for the Jew leaving.[^99]
   If this Jew moving in afterwards is not going to do the bedika (he is not shomer mitzvos) then the Jew leaving will have to do a bedika.[^100]
4. If the Jew leaving is not going to be living anywhere else at all (like if they are traveling over Pesach), and nobody is moving in after him, then he does need to do a bedika.[^97]
   However, if the goyish owner of the house is going to move back into the house after the Jew leaves but before Pesach, then they Jew does not need to do a bedika.[^101] {<font color="#ff0000">I don't understand why this is.</font>}
## Renting From a Yid
### Who Needs to Do the Bedika
#### Renting from Before the 14th
1. If the tenant has the key and did a maaseh kinyan before the night of the 14th began, he is required to do the bedika.[^102] {<font color="#ff0000">This halacha may apply to renting a house from non-Jewish</font>}
2. If the owner of the house has the and no maaseh kinyan was done, then it is on the owner to do the bedika.[^102]
3. If the tenant received the key before the beginning of the night of the 14th, but did not make a maaseh kinyan, then both the tenant and the owner need to do the bedika (or one can appoint the other to be his shliach).[^103]
   The lashon of the mishan berurah (in Sif Katan 2) sounds more like the chiyuv is on the owner rather than the tenant, so perhaps the tenant has more of a right to make the owner be the shliach to do the bedika rather than the other way around.[^39]
   {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">What happens if there is a maaseh kinyan but the key was not given over?</span>}
4. Once the night begins, the chiyuv to do the bedika is on the owner. Giving the key over to the tenant after the night began does not make a difference.[^104]
#### Renting on the 14th
1. If the house was rented on the 14th by day or in middle of the night and there isn't enough time to do the bedika, the tenant should ask the owner if the bedika has already been done yet.[^105]
2. If the tenant can't get in touch with the owner, he can ask the wife or children (even under bar or bas mitzva) if the bedika has been done.[^105]
3. If the tenant can't get in touch with anyone assume that the bedika has already been done. As such, the tenant would not have to do a bedika.[^106]
4. If the owner of the house is not frum, then it would seem that the tenant would not be able to rely on the owner having done a bedika, perhaps even if the owner explicitly told him that it was bodek.[^107] See [[#If Bedika was not Done Before Yom Tov|here]] about what one should do in this situation.
#### The Owner Agreed to do the Bedika
1. If the tenant and owner agreed that the owner would do the bedika, and it turns out that the owner did not take follow through with his word, the tenant would have to take care of the bedika.[^108]
   {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">If the owner is around, it may perhaps be his responsibility to do the bedika. I need to look into this more.</span>}
2. Even if the tenant paid extra for the bedika to be done, the tenant cannot claim that the rental was a מקח טעות or even get a refund on the extra amount that was paid.
   This is because bedikas chametz is a mitzvah and so we don't view it as a negative that the tenant has an extra opportunity to do a mitzvah.[^109] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Even so, perhaps the owner should give the money back anyway. Need to look into this.</span>}
### Bitul
1. In all cases, the owner should do a bitul.[^110]
   If none of the chametz in the house was the owner's (like if the owner did not live in the house since the previous Pesach), then perhaps a bitul is not required.[^39]
2. Once the tenant receives the key, according to some people, he is koneh the chametz in the house. As such, if he receives the key before yom tov, he should do a bitul, even if he is not staying there over Pesach.[^110]
   However, if the tenant knows that the owner was mevatel the chametz, then the tenant would not need to do a bittul.[^111]
# Relying on Women and Ketanim for Bedika
1. A woman and a katan are relied upon if they said that they did a bedika in a situation that one is mevatel as well (as this makes the chiyuv to do the bedika only a derabanan).[^112] However, this is not lechatchila.[^113] {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I assume that the katan needs to have reached the age of chinuch.</span>}
2. Even a divorced woman should have a man do the bedika for her, if possible.[^114]
3. {<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">It seems hard to imagine that this applies nizman hazeh. However, the previous halacha (about a divorced women having men do the bedika is from Rav Elyashiv.</span>}
# Selling Chametz to a Goy
1. It is preferable for the sale of chametz to a goy to go into effect on the 13th day rather than on the 14th night. However, it is okay if not.[^101]
2. When selling chametz, one should be more inclusive when discussing the chametz that is being sold, rather than more specific. For example, a person should say that all the chametz in a certain room is being sold, rather than specify that the package of cookies or whatever is being sold. This is preferable because it will include chametz that one didn't find.[^101]

[^66]: I don't understand the connection between these two points. Why is it that just because one should begin learning the halachos of Pesach at this time does that mean that the chiyuv for the bedika begins at this time as well?

[^71]: It seems that one violates this issur for purposely putting chametz in a place that is inaccessible but without being mevatel the chametz. We view leaving one's home as making the chametz inaccessible.

[^73]: Siman 436 Sif Katan 5
[^74]: Siman 436 Sif Katan 16
[^75]: It seems from Siman 436 Sif Katan 23 that the halachos are the same by both cases.
[^76]: Own thoughts. This is also mashma from the mishna berura because in the mishna berura does not make mention of being mevatel the chametz when discussing this case, while by the case of of one appointing a shliach (brought down in Siman 436 Sif Katan 3), the mishna berura does mention that one should be mevatel the chametz.
