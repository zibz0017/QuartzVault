# Description
1. A leveraged ETF tracks either an asset or an index and moves some multiple of the percentage change of that asset or index. For example, if you have a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P, if the S&P goes up 1%, this ETF will go up 2%.[^1]
2. It increases risk and reward compared to standard ETFs.[^1]
3. This multiplication is accomplished by using derivatives and debt.[^1]
4. Usually, these ETFs are 2x or 3x.[^1]
# Reverse Leveraged ETFs
1. Some leveraged ETFs have a negative multiplier (-2x or -3x).
2. That means that if the tracked asset or index decreases by 1%, this ETF grows by 2 or 3 percent.
